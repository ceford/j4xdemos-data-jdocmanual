## Meta-Beschreibung

Die Meta-Beschreibung gibt Dir die MÃ¶glichkeit den Inhalt der Seite in
einem Absatz zusammenzufassen. Diese Beschreibung kann von Suchmaschinen
verwendet werden, um Deine Webseite auf ihren Ergebnisseiten zu zeigen.

### Do I need to include a meta description? I thought search engines didn't use them any more?

With the advent of contextual 'semantic' markup which allows a website
to provide a context for the information, sometimes search engines will
find more relevant information within the page itself or from other
sources which link to that page (such as DMOZ) and use that in
preference to your meta description. This does **not** mean that the
meta description is not used, it simply means that if more relevant
information is found to describe that page in search listings, a search
engine may use that information rather than your specified description.
In fact, Google recommends that every page on your site has it's own
unique meta description.

### Recommendations for creating meta descriptions

When preparing meta descriptions for your pages, try to keep the total
word count less than 155 characters, as there is a limit to the number
of characters displayed in search results pages, so if you exceed this
your text may be truncated. The meta description (if used) is one of the
key factors that a person searching uses to decide whether your link is
relevant to their search, so make sure that it makes sense to read,
contains your keywords, and explains what is on the page. It is possible
to dramatically improve your click through rate in search engines by
making sure your meta descriptions are well optimised and relevant to
the content on the page.

Google recommends the following to ensure that you gain the most from
your search engine indexing:

- Ensure every page has unique, relevant meta descriptions
- Ensure you apply metadata for listing pages (e.g. blog & list layouts)
  in addition to individual articles - this is commonly overlooked on
  Joomla! websites
- Include factual information if relevant (e.g. blog articles may
  include the author, products might include the price or manufacturer)
- Consider using automatically generated metadata - but make sure it's
  relevant, readable and accurate
- Make your descriptions descriptive!

### Joomla! has a global setting for meta description doesn't it?

Joomla! does indeed have a global field for meta description, which you
can find under Global Configuration \> Site \> Global Site Meta
Description. This will be used on any page within your site which does
not have it's own meta description specified, so it can be a 'get out
clause' if you don't want to create a meta description for each page,
however search engines do not like duplicate title or meta description
tags - using this approach you will inevitably have many pages with the
same meta description.

Consider carefully if you wish to complete these fields - in most cases
the meta description in global configuration can be left blank.
