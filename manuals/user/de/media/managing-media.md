<!-- Filename: J4.x:Managing_Media / Display title: Medien verwalten -->

## Einführung

In Joomla, media are images and files that appear as illustrations or
links in articles, modules, templates and so on. An important feature of
media is that they are delivered directly by the web server without
being processed by Joomla code. This is fast and efficient. Also, be
aware that media are usually stored in the **images** folder of your
Joomla web site. Do not confuse this with the **media** folder, which
contains javascript and style sheet files.

Image and file media are managed with the Media component of Joomla. It
allows you to organise media content in a folder tree, upload individual
items, perform some elementary image editing functions, and place images
and links directly into articles.

## How to Access

From the Joomla Administrator interface there are several routes to open
the Media component:

- Select **Content **→** Media** from the Administrator menu.
- Select **Site panel **→** Media** from the Home Dashboard.
- Select **CMS Content **→** Media** from an article edit screen.

In the first two cases the Media component appears in a normal component
screen. In the last it appears in a modal dialog.

## Screenshot

The following image shows the Media page just after Joomla installation
but with the cassiopeia/sampledata folder selected:

\[\[File:J4.x-media-cassiopeia-sampledata-en.jpg\|800px\]\]

## Managing Folders

The sub-folder names in your images folder tree become part of the image
url so it is important for linking and search engine optimisation
purposes that the names conform to a convention:

- all lower case
- no spaces or punctuation
- if necessary, use a minus sign to create human readable words, for
  example deciduous-trees rather than deciduous_trees.

Before creating much content for your site it may pay to think ahead to
how you might categorise your content and perhaps create an images
folder tree that is similar to your category tree. Otherwise you may end
up with a very large number of images and files in the root of your
images tree and that will become difficult to manage. If you decide to
move images into a better structure later you will have to find the
links to those images in your articles and change them. That could be a
time-consuming, daunting task!

### Folder Navigation

Use the folder tree in the **Local** column to select a folder. In the
case illustrated above the cassiopeia folder was first selected. That
revealed the sampledata folder which was then select to show its
content.

The current location is also indicated in the breadcrumbs above the
images. In this case **images **→** cassiopeia **→** sampledata**.

If you select a different folder the previous folder at the same level
closes.

### Creating a folder

- Select the parent folder under which the new folder should be created.
- Select the **Create New Folder** button.
- In the *Create New Folder* popup window, enter a name for the folder
  in the **Folder Name** field.
- Click the **Create** button.
- The new folder will appear in in the selected parent folder along with
  a green Success system message.

### Deleting a folder

***Warning: deleting a folder will also delete all contents of the
folder!***

- Select the parent of the folder to be deleted using the directory tree
  shown under **Local**. That will show all of the folders and files in
  the parent.
- Move the cursor over the folder to be deleted in the media area. It
  will turn grey and a white button will appear near the top left.
- Select the white button. A green tick will appear to indicate it is
  selected.
- Select the **Delete** button from the Toolbar.
- In the **Confirm Delete** popup dialog select the **Delete** button.
  The folder will be deleted along with all of it files, subfolders and
  their files.

The folder selected for deletion is illustrated below:

\[\[File:J4.x-media-delete-folder-en.jpg\|800px\]\]

## Media Area Toolbar

This is the bar above the list of images, files and folders that has
buttons for a variety of tasks.

### Select box

A check box that allows you to select all of the items in the folder
displayed in the media area. You might want to use it to delete all of
the current items without deleting the folder.

### Breadcrumbs

Use the folder names above the media area to go backwards in the folder
hierarchy.

Double click a folder name in the media area to open that folder.

### Search

If you have a long list of images and files you can search for items
containing any group of characters. The search is progressive: as you
add characters to the search term the list is reduced to just those
containing that character string.

### Magnify

Use the magnify buttons to enlarge or reduce the thumbnail size.
Depending on the size of your screen you may see 2, 4, 6 or 8 thumbnail
images side by side.

### List or Thumbnail Views

In thumbnail view, select the list symbol to switch to list view. In
list view, select the thumbnail symbol to switch to thumbnail view. In
list view you will see information on image size and dimensions, amongst
other data.

### Information

Select the Information icon to open a side panel showing information
about whatever is selected.
