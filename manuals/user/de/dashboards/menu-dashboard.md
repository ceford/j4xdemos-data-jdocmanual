<!-- Filename: J4.x:Menu_Dashboard / Display title: Dashboard-MenÃ¼ -->

## Introduction

To open the Menu Dashboard select the dashboard icon to the right of the
Menu item in the Administrator menu. The default dashboard contains two
panels, one for Menus & Menu Items and one for items in individual Site
menus. Neither can be edited or unpublished.

You can have as many Site and Administrator menus as you like in almost
any position you like. This feature is often used to show different
menus to different User Groups after login.
