<!-- Filename: J4.x:Installing_Joomla / Display title: Instalación de Joomla -->

Esta es una página temporal hasta que se lance Joomla 4. Hasta entonces,
eche un vistazo a [Instalación de Joomla!
3.x](https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Installing_Joomla "J3.x:Installing Joomla")

Installing Joomla! for the first time is very easy. After completion of
the preliminary steps, setting up a hosting environment and creating a
database, Joomla’s built-in web installer will set up your new site in
just a few minutes. The previous steps:

### Hosting Setup

If you have not yet set up a hosting environment you need to do it now,
either on a hosting service or your local computer. Read the [Hosting
Setup](https://docs.joomla.org/J4.x:Hosting_Setup "J4.x:Hosting Setup")
tutorial for details.

Also, there are some PHP settings that need to be sufficient for Joomla
to install. The settings are usually in a *php.ini* or *user.ini*
configuration file on the server. If you are on shared hosting, talk to
your hosting service about how to change these settings if it is
possible to do so. If working on a localhost, for example with
[XAMPP](https://docs.joomla.org/XAMPP "Special:MyLanguage/XAMPP"), or a
VPS or dedicated host, you should not be restricted by these settings
and can set them yourself.

The minimum values for the *php.ini* file are shown below:

- *memory_limit:* 256M
- *upload_max_filesize:* 30M
- *post_max_size:* 30M
- *max_execution_time:* 30

It is possible to work with lower values of upload_max_filesize and
post_max_size but larger extensions will fail to upload and cause
unpredictable problems.

### Database Setup

If you have not yet set up a database do it now. It is covered for a
hosting service in the [Hosting
Setup](https://docs.joomla.org/J4.x:Hosting_Setup "J4.x:Hosting Setup")
tutorial. There is also a [Creating a Database for
Joomla!](https://docs.joomla.org/Creating_a_Database_for_Joomla! "Special:MyLanguage/Creating a Database for Joomla!")
tutorial that covers localhost and phpMyAdmin methods.

You will need to note basic database information needed when the actual
Joomla installation is started.

- Location of database, usually *localhost* even on a hosting service.
  It can be a specific host's server such as *`dbserver1.yourhost.com`*.
- The database name
- The database user's name
- The database user's password

## Prepare for Install

### Downloading and Uploading Joomla! Package Files

Download the current release of Joomla! from the link on the
<a href="https://downloads.joomla.org/" class="external text"
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Download Joomla</a> page

Move the downloaded Joomla installation package zip file to the server.
For a hosting service you may use the cPanel File Manager Upload
function or you may use an FTP Client to transfer the downloaded Joomla
4.x zip file to your server. There are several FTP clients available.
Here is a detailed <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_FTP_client_software"
class="external text" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Comparison of FTP client software</a>.
If in doubt, use FileZilla.

Your Server's "root" Folder

It is better to move the downloaded zip package to your server and
unpack it there than to unpack it locally and then move the file tree.
Normally you upload your web files to the root folder of your hosting
service. This is typically named *public_html* but other variations
include *htdocs* and this depends on how your host has the set up the
server. For Joomla purposes, you can load the files directly into
*public_html* or a sub-folder you have created within it.

alt="Stop hand nuvola.svg.png" />

Warning!

The zip package files can be extracted directly on the host using
various command line tools (e.g. unzip), which needs to be installed on
the server. If your hosting service uses the admin tool cPanel, the
Extract button can be pressed in the File Manager. Apart from that, the
free third-party tool
<a href="https://www.akeeba.com/products/akeeba-kickstart.html"
class="external text" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Akeeba Kickstart</a> may also be used
for this purpose. The unzipped files and directories will be placed in
the current folder. Extraction on your local computer depends on your
OS. Try a right-click and see if there is an extract menu. In this case
your OS may put the files in a folder with the same name as the zip
file. After extraction you may delete the zip file and rename the
extraction folder to something short and suitable for use in a url.

## Start Install

With the above requirements met, a database created and the required
Joomla files in place, you are ready to install Joomla. Start the Joomla
web installer by opening your favourite browser and browsing to the
site's domain name. On a hosting installation you will use

*`https://www.yoursitename.com`*.

If your are installing Joomla locally, you will use

*`http://localhost/<`*

` `` `

path to Joomla files

`>`

and you should see the installation screen

. \[\[File:

J4x_Installation_screen_page_1.png

\|border\|right\|500px\]\]

Joomla will try to identify the *Select Language* field automatically
from your browser's language. You can change this if needed.

Fill in the following information.

- **Site Name**: The name of your website — this can be changed at any
  point later in the [Site Global
  Configuration](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Site_Global_Configuration#Site "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Site Global Configuration")
  page.

When everything on the first page is completed, click the *Setup Login
Data* button to proceed.

## Login Data

You should now see the login data screen

. \[\[File:

J4x_Installation_screen_page_2.png

\|border\|right\|500px\]\]

Fill in the following information.

- **Real Name**: The name of the Super User. This is how Joomla will
  greet you when you log in.
- **Super User account username**: The username for the *Super User*.
  Avoid using *admin* (a good [My
  Profile](https://docs.joomla.org/Security_Checklist/Joomla!_Setup#Change_the_default_administrator_username "Special:MyLanguagehttps://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Site_My_Profile")
  in the *Administration* interface to change it later.
- **Admin Password**: Remember that a Super User has maximum control of
  the Site and Administrator interfaces, so use a difficult password.
  Use [My
  Profile](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Site_My_Profile "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Site My Profile")
  in the *Administration* interface to change it later.
- **Super User Email Address**: The Super User email address. Enter a
  valid email in case you forget your password. This is the email
  address where you'll receive a link to change the Super User password.

When everything on the second page is completed, click the *Setup
Database Connection* button to proceed.

## Database Configuration

Enter the database information noted down when you created the database
for this installation. You may also read or review [Creating a Database
for
Joomla!](https://docs.joomla.org/Creating_a_Database_for_Joomla! "Special:MyLanguage/Creating a Database for Joomla!").

\[\[File:

J40_Installation_screen_page_3.png

\|border\|right\|500px\]\]

For simplification, these instructions are a reference to installing
with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQLi" class="extiw"
title="wikipedia:MySQLi">MySQLi</a> database. The instructions on the
installation page are self explanatory, but here they are again:

- **Database Type**: MySQLi is the common database used
- **Hostname** Where your database is located. Common is *localhost*,
  even on hosting services. However, some hosts use a specific database
  server such as

*dbserver1.yourhost.com*.

- **Username**: The username used to connect to the database
- **Password**: The password for the database user (not your
  Administrator password)
- **Database Name**: The name of the database
- **Table Prefix**: This is generated automatically as a security
  feature. You can accept the randomly generated default or change it.
  Just don't forget to put the underscore character

(`_`)

at the end of the prefix.

- **Connection Encryption**: specifies how the connection to the
  database should be encrypted. If you don't know - then it's best to
  stick to the default. However this allows enterprises that use one or
  two way authentication for the database connection to provide it.

All these choices and more can be edited on the [Site Global
Configuration](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Site_Global_Configuration#Server "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Site Global Configuration")
page, under *Server Options* after the installation is completed. Note,
you will break your installation if you change these settings after
installation unless you have a complete copy of the current database
being used by the Joomla installation. Common uses would be to update
the username and password of the database or to complete a move of an
existing installation to a new host with different parameters.

After you click the *Install Joomla* button, you should see the Joomla
logo spinning. Once the installation completes, you should see the
success page.

## Finishing Up

### Success and Finishing Up the Installation

Congratulations! Joomla! 4 is now installed.

\[\[File:

J40_Installation_screen_page_4.png

\|border\|right\|500px\]\]

If you want to start using Joomla right away without [installing extra
languages](https://docs.joomla.org/J4.x:Installing_Joomla#Installing_Extra_Languages "Special:MyLanguage/J4.x:Installing Joomla")
you can select *Open Administrator* to go to the *Administrator
Dashboard* or select *Open Site* to go to the Site Home page.

You may see a section with recommended PHP settings.

- **Recommended Settings**: These settings are recommended in your PHP
  configuration, but will not prevent Joomla! from being installed. You
  can refer to the above instructions on how they may be changed if
  there is a need to do so.

=== Extra Languages ===

As part of the Joomla installation process you are given the opportunity
to install additional languages before you complete the installation.

To do this select the Install Additional Languages button

This will take you to an extra installation page allowing you to select
the languages you require.

==== Install Additional Languages ====

A list of language packs is displayed.

\[\[File:

J40_Installation_screen_page_5.png

\|right\|500px\]\]

Select up to 3 languages you wish to install. (More than 3 at once can
cause timeout issues; you can install more later.)

Remember the following:

- Language packs included in custom distributions will not be listed at
  this stage as they are already installed.
- A version of the packs proposed will match the Joomla Major version
  (4.0.x, 4.1.x, etc.). The minor version of the pack may not
  correspond, e.g. you are installing version 4.0.3 and a 4.0.2 language
  pack is shown.
- Unmatched language packs in the above example may have untranslated
  strings.
- The unmatched language packs will be offered as an update when the
  packs are updated by the registered Translation teams. The available
  update will be shown in the Control panel as well as in **Extensions
  Manager **→** Update**. This behaviour is similar to **Extensions
  Manager **→** Install Languages**.

Click *Next* and a progress bar will be displayed while the language
pack or packs are installed.

==== Choose the Default Language ==== When the installation of the
languages is complete you will now be presented with a similar
*Congratulations! Your Joomla site is ready.* screen. The difference
will be a list of the installed languages allowing you to select the
default language for the Site and the Administrator interface.

\[\[File:

J40_Installation_screen_page_4_default_langs.png

\|border\|right\|500\]\]

- Select the default language you wish to use.

<!-- -->

- When you have selected the default language, click the *Set default
  language* button to confirm.
- A system message will be displayed confirming Joomla has set the
  default ADMINISTRATOR and SITE language. That message can be closed.

==== Finalise ====

You can now can navigate to the *Administrator Dashboard*. Log in by
selecting *Open Administrator* or go right to your site Home page by
selecting *Open Site*.
