<!-- Filename: Why_Migrate / Display title: Por que migrar -->

Undecided if you should migrate or not? After all, your site is running
fine. Why rock the boat? Somehow you’ve heard/learned that you need to
migrate to a newer life cycle or version and landed here. You’ve come to
the right place. This documentation is a funnel. At the bottom of each
page there are up to two options to take you to the next step. Now, here
are all the reasons to take the plunge to Joomla 4.x!

First of all, you have to check which [Version of
Joomla!](https://docs.joomla.org/How_to_check_the_Joomla_version%3F "Special:MyLanguage/How to check the Joomla version?")
is running on your website.

## Por que devo migrar?

A Joomla! migration gives everyone a new opportunity to:

- Revisit site goals and rethink its purpose
- Clean up “great ideas” that never saw the light of day
- Inventory third-party extensions that may have been installed but not
  used
- Simplify and clean up old articles, menus and other content
- Create new functionality on the site
- Change design and navigation
- Add accessibility to disabled visitors
- Make the site mobile-friendly
- Improve search engine optimization
- Utilize new features you may have been using third-party extensions
  for
- Insure your data against security breaches by having all the latest
  software

### Recursos e melhorias de usabilidade

Typically new life cycles of Joomla include new features and usability
enhancements. These sometimes can eliminate the need of a third-party
extension and enable the increased use of Joomla core components. Read

### Mudanças tecnológicas

Significant changes have taken place! Major releases of Joomla have
restructured the data and require a “migration” as opposed to an update
or upgrade. Technology changes have also been made within the versions
of PHP and MySQL running on your hosts server. These changes force all
content management system (CMS) technology to change with it.

### Segurança

When a CMS changes its structure, a migration is required. The previous
version will only be supported for two years from the release of the new
life cycle. This creates potential problems with security as security
patches are discontinued and unsupported versions of Joomla are not
maintained.

Many hosts don’t want older software scripts (Joomla is a script - all
third-party extensions are scripts) running on their servers because
security is compromised as software ages. They have to update their
servers to remain secure. More and more older versions of Joomla cease
functioning because of server upgrades on the part of the host.

## Migração é como mudar para uma casa nova ou fazer uma reforma

You can think of migration like moving from one home to a new home. You
filter through your belongings and furniture and pack the important
pieces to take with you. You discard lingering trash or eliminate items
you no longer need. Once you get into your new home, you may find you
need to acquire some new pieces of furniture or fixtures to make your
new home operate smoothly.

Same with migration. You are deciding what to take with you and what to
get rid of on your site. What stays? What goes?

When you move to a new house, you may have the skills and expertise to
move the entire household yourself or you may need to get some help
moving (not everyone can move a piano by themselves). You may only need
your own two hands and a few boxes. Alternatively, you may need a moving
service with a gigantic truck and a lot of helpers. Same is true with
migrating from one life cycle of Joomla to another.
