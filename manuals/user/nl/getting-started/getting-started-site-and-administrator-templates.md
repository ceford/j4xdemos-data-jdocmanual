<!-- Filename: J4.x:Getting_Started:_Site_and_Administrator_templates / Display title: Aan de slag: Website- en Beheerder-templates -->

## Introduction

Joomla websites have two separate interfaces:

- The Site interface is seen by site visitors. Its appearance is
  controlled by a site template. The default site template is named
  Cassiopeia - a simple template with some options for customisation.
  Other templates are available for free or for a small fee. Indeed,
  there is an extensive industry based on the supply of custom
  templates.
- The Administrator interface is seen and used by those who create
  content. It looks completely different because it serves a different
  purpose. Although some customisation is possible it is best left alone
  to preserve functionality. Access to the Administrator interface is
  obtained by appending */administrator* to the root URL of the site.

Items to notice:

- The top blue bar is the *Header*, typically containing a Logo and a
  Company name. You can add an image to use as a logo and change
  Cassiopeia to whatever you want.
- The boxes to the right labeled *Main Menu* and *Login Form* are
  examples of modules. The grey bar containing *You are here:* is a
  *Breadcrumb* module. It shows where you are in a page tree, useful in
  complex sites.
- *Home* is where the content appears. In a new installation this is a
  list of *Featured Articles*. But there are no articles yet so it is
  empty. First job: create an article and mark it *Featured*.

Items to notice:

- At the top is the Title bar containing the Joomla Logo, the Title of
  the page on display and a group of Information icons. They are on
  every page but disabled on Edit pages. To find out what they do: try
  them.
- The default page is the *Home Dashboard*. It contains panels grouping
  together often used Management features. You can add and remove panels
  as you please. And you can add items to panels and remove items too.
- The column to the left is the *Administrator Menu*. This provides
  access to the most commonly used features. The right bracket marker
  (\>) indicates that this menu opens to reveal more items. The group of
  four squares marker opens a dashboard that also contains panels
  grouping together commonly used features.
- The Toggle button collapses or expands the menu on demand to provide
  more workspace.
