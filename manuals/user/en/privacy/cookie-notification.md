## Summary of cookie use on basic Joomla! installations

Joomla uses cookies to store information about a number of things. These
include your session, which means it saves information on what you have
done on the site during this current visit (for example what pages you
have visited and whether you have logged in).

Features such as "Remember me" use cookies that last longer than your
session in order to save your login information.

Some Joomla extensions may create their own cookies.

## Notifying users of cookies use

Whether for legal or other reasons, webmasters may wish to notify site
visitors about the use of cookies. This can be done in a number of ways
which are up to webmasters to implement as appropriate for their sites.

Some possible methods are:

- Include a summary of cookie use in a site's privacy policy.
- Include a statement of cookie use in a site's terms of service.
- Use a custom html module to display information about cookies on each
  page of a site.
- If using the Remember Me option for login use the message field in the
  login module and login layout to inform visitors that this feature
  uses a cookie.
