- Go to extensions\>\>Module Manager
- Find the Feed Display module
- Enter the URL of the feed.
- Save and display the module like any other module.

A second way is to use the News Feeds component that comes with Joomla!

- In the administrator go to components\>\>News Feeds
- In the component you can manage your news feeds and assign them to
  categories.
- To show the feeds on the front end make a component link in your menu.
