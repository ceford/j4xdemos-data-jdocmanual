## Use RSS Feeds to Share Content

Some search engines allow you to submit feeds to them for use in their
search functions, and many people use an RSS feed reader to be notified
when websites they are interested in post new content. This is a
powerful way for sites that regularly update their content to get
traffic to their new items. This procedure will explain how to create
feeds for pages within your site, be it static or not.

In the Joomla Administrator, under the advanced parameters for a dynamic
page (e.g. category blog view) menu item, make sure that the *Show a
feed link* item is set to *Show*.

View the site in the Frontend, then right click and select *View
source*. Search the source for *feed*, and you'll find the RSS feed link
to that page.

For dynamic pages where the content is changing regularly, it is useful
to show an icon to allow visitors to add that page to their feed
readers.

**Note** You should have SEF enabled for this to work well.
