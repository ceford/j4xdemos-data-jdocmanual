<!-- Filename: Changing_the_Login_Form_module_settings / Display title: Changing the Login Form module settings -->

To change settings which control the information shown in the Login Form
module and some aspects of its behaviour, do this:

1.  Log in to the Administrator back-end. To learn how to do this read:
    [Logging in or out of the Administrator
    back-end](https://docs.joomla.org/Logging_in_or_out_of_the_Administrator_back-end "Special:MyLanguage/Logging in or out of the Administrator back-end").
2.  Click the **Extensions **→** Modules** menu item.
3.  From the list of Modules find the type one called "Login". There may
    be several pages of Modules listed so you might need to look on
    subsequent pages. You can make the search easier by clicking the
    drop-down list containing *Select Type* and clicking the "Login"
    item (they are listed in alphabetical order).
4.  Click the Module Name, ie. **Login Form**.
5.  You will see the "Module: \[Edit\]" screen which contains four
    groups of fields: Module, Menu Assignment, Advanced and Module
    Permissions.
6.  Make the changes you need to make.
7.  Click the **Save** or **Save & Close** toolbar button to implement
    the new settings:
    - The **Save** toolbar button will save your changes but leave you
      in the Module Edit screen.
    - The **Save & Close** toolbar button will save your changes and
      return you to the Module list screen.
8.  You should see a green message: "Module successfully saved" which
    confirms that your changes have been saved.
