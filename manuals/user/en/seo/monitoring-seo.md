## Why Monitor Your Site?

Monitoring your site is important to ensure that you notice developing
problems before they emerge and can take action to minimise any problems
that might affect your position in search engines or the experience for
your users.

There are several metrics that you could monitor - thousands, in fact -
but most of us are too busy to dig into every nook and cranny and find
every piece of data.

For this reason, there are several ways to combine the data you need to
monitor into one central location. Google Analytics has some great
resources available in the form of custom segments and dashboards, that
can be shared individually or as a package.

## What to Monitor

Deciding what to monitor really depends on your business or organisation
and what is important to them. Ecommerce sites will have a different
interest to blogging and news sites, for example.

In this series of articles we'll consider some general metrics to
monitor, along with some sector-specific metrics. These articles assume
that you have
<a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/"
class="external text" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Google Analytics</a> running on your
website.

## How to Monitor Your Site

Monitoring your website can be challenging. There are so many metrics
that you need to keep an eye on, and different places you might want to
gather data from.

Google Analytics allows you to embed some JavaScript code within your
website that tracks the source of visits, and also the pages that the
visitor passes through while they are browsing your site.

It gathers a huge amount of information including how many pages they
visited, how long they spent on each page, if they dropped out of a
purchase (and at which point they dropped out), how much was spent. The
data is mind boggling.

This often results in being overwhelmed with the choices available, and
choosing only to look at the standard 'overview' chart showing how many
have visited your site in a specified time frame.

While this is useful as a start, it only scrapes the surface of the
information you could analyse. The number of persons visiting your site
is a 'blunt' metric. It doesn't give you an idea about how engaged they
are, or what they do when they visit. It also doesn't warn you about
problems that could be developing that may be masked. For example if you
are starting to see a reduction in the number of 'organic' searches
(searches that come from a search engine and are not via paid
advertising) that might cause problems in the future.

Google appreciates the fact that the information we want to see is
distributed in several places across its web-based interface, and often
people do not have the time to hunt out the relevant page, filter the
data, and analyse the information. Therefore, they launched some helpful
features that makes it much easier to see exactly what you need with a
couple of clicks every time you come into Analytics. These will be
referred to throughout the monitoring section of the SEO Portal, so it's
useful to become acquainted with them now.

## Useful Tools

### Custom Segments

Custom Segments (or Advanced Segments) provide you with the ability to
chop up or 'segment' the information in any part of Google Analytics, by
filtering the data. This can be used, for example, when looking at 'All
visits', to segment the graph into organic and paid visits, or to show
how many came using 1, 2, 3 or 4+ keywords.

Custom segments are quite easy to set up. Choose which parameters you
wish to use to create the filter using a drop-down select box and
entering values. (If you're comfortable with regular expressions, use
them.) For example, we might set up a segment:

Show me *visits* where keywords is *equal to 2*.

This would filter the data we are viewing to show all visits where two
keywords were used.

The power of custom segments is huge. It allows you to selectively
include and exclude data for any metric that can be used or analysed in
Google Analytics.

To get started with using a Custom Segment, simply click the arrow at
the top of the page to display the custom segments available (outlined
in red). If you have none available, you can either create your own, or
import existing segments from the Google Analytics Gallery (outlined in
blue).

width="1582" height="1587" alt="Googleanalyticscustomsegments.png" />

Once you have chosen which segments you wish to use, press apply and
they will be applied to the data you are viewing. Below you can see the
filters being applied to show one, two, three, and three+ keywords.

width="1579" height="2852"
alt="Googleanalyticscustomsegmentskeywords.png" />

### Dashboards

Google also rolled out a useful feature called Dashboards. This is a
collection of 'widgets' in a single place, allowing you to get a quick
overview of key data in one place. Before dashboards you might have to
go into multiple views, run multiple filters, make sure you selected the
right data. Now you can simply open the dashboard and view the data.

Dashboards can be used for any purpose and you can create (and share)
your own dashboards easily with a couple of clicks.

To get started, simply expand the Dashboards section of your Analytics
profile

decoding="async" data-file-width="1580" data-file-height="1119"
width="1580" height="1119" alt="Googleanayticsdashboard.png" />

### The Google Analytics Gallery

Shortly after the Custom Segments and Dashboards were rolled out, it
became evident that there was a need for a 'gallery' where people could
share their segments and dashboards with others. This is a great way to
get started with dashboards. You can install multiple pre-created
packages that consist of segments and dashboards for specific purposes.
For example, an Ecommerce bundle might include dashboards to monitor
revenue, goal abandonment, mobile Ecommerce and so forth.

All you have to do is visit the gallery, choose the items you wish to
install, and select the profile you wish to use.

### Cyfe Dashboards

When you are managing SEO you need to have a complete view of everything
going on in the business â€“ from whether your servers are online to how
many visits have been made on your social network profiles through to
conversions on your website, organic traffic rates, revenue, and more.

It is often difficult to manage all this. At a basic level it means four
or five tabs open and flicking between them to get an idea of what is
going on.

<a href="https://www.cyfe.com/" class="external text" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Cyfe.com</a> is a great tool that can
be found via the Google Analytics Apps Gallery. Cyfe allows you to
create dashboards and import all kinds of data from a staggering number
of sources. Joomla! users can get a discount on a paid account if you
mention the Documentation project.

This allows you to have multiple dashboards where you can quickly see
all the metrics relating to the marketing for your website. Then you
could click onto another dashboard and see the metrics relating to
sales, and another to see social interaction, another to look at
content.
