<!-- Filename: J4.x:Hosting_Setup / Display title: Hosting Setup -->

## Introduction

This page provides some guidance for anyone completely new to hosting
technology. You can set up a website on your own laptop or desktop
computer. This is known as local hosting and is a good way to experiment
with new features and is completely free. To make your website content
available to the rest of the world you will need an account on a hosting
service and for that you will have to pay.

## Hosting Service

Commercial hosting services provide everything you need to support a
website. Some also provide one-click installation of popular
applications such as Content Management Systems, Bulletin Boards, Wikis
and so on. But please note: Joomla Forum gurus do not recommend using
one-click installation. Each hosting service offers different plans at
different price levels. The more you pay the more disk space and
bandwidth you get, along with more email addresses, databases and so on.
Some also provide a free domain name.

You can obtain a minimal hosting plan for about Â£50 per year. This plan
level is often referred to as shared hosting and is suitable for
anything not involving sensitive data. Businesses should seek specialist
advice on suitable hosting plans. Choosing a hosting service is not
without problems. The cheapest may have unduly restrictive *php.ini*
settings that do not appear in their advertising. Some may have a poor
reputation for support.

If you opt for a shared hosting plan check the following:

- Support for PHP applications such as Joomla, WordPress and Mediawiki.
- Disk space: 500Mb is an absolute minimum. 1Gb or more would be better
  if you plan on using lots of images.
- Number of Databases: Joomla uses one but you will soon find you need 5
  or 10 or more. Some plans offer an unlimited number within the total
  disk space allocation.
- Database size: with Smart Search the database can grow very quickly.
  If shared hosting has a restriction on the size of the database, it
  will be important to find out what this is. It can lead to a site not
  working.
- Number of email addresses: plenty!
- Number of HTTP and DB connections to the server, which some shared
  hosts limit
- Backups: how are these done, and is there a Terms of Service (TOS)
  document stating who is responsible for backups.

Also check the control panel and platform offered. Judging from Forum
posts, most use cPanel on Linux. The hosting service should provide all
of the basic website support software:

- Apache web server 2.4+ - *directory indexes* should be disabled. Also
  supported:
  - Nginx 1.18+ (fewer users so less Forum support)
  - Microsoft IIS\[6\] (fewer users so less Forum support)
- MySQLi database 5.6+ or MariaDB clone with InnoDB support. Also
  supported:
  - PostgreSQL 11.0+ (fewer users so less Forum support).
- PHP 8+ is recommended, the minimum is 7.2.5.
- phpMyAdmin database management tool.

Before buying, check the following minimal PHP requirements for Joomla:

- *memory_limit* - Minimum: 256M
- *upload_max_filesize* - Minimum: 32M
- *post_max_size* - Minimum: 32M
- *max_execution_time* - Recommended: 30
- *allow_url_fopen* - true

Many of these parameters may be set by the user in cPanel. Ask if that
is possible.

If you have purchased a domain name your hosting service will configure
it for you. They should also provide you with an IP address to use until
your domain registration propagates to Domain Name Servers (DNS),
usually a few hours.

## cPanel Hosting

When you login to your cPanel hosting service, this is what you should
expect to see:

alt="J4.x-hosting-setup-cpanel-en.png" />

### Database Setup

The Databases panel is used to create a database and database user for
Joomla.

Select the MySQL Databases item and enter a database name in the form.
The first part of the form is predefined. The rest is up to to you. It
should be short and perhaps not obvious - *jblog* for example.

In the same form, go down to the *Add New User* section. Enter a user
name. This can be anything you like. It will be used in your Joomla
configuration file so it is not something you need to remember. Use the
password generator to create an unmemorable password and copy it to a
text editor - you will need it during Joomla installation.

In the same form, go down to *Add User to Database*. Select the user you
created and the database you created from the drop-down lists and then
click the Add button. A form to Manage Privileges opens. Select the *All
Privileges* check box and then click the *Make Changes* button.

That is it - you now have a database ready for a Joomla installation.

### Upload Joomla Source

At some stage you will have downloaded the Joomla source code zip file
to your own laptop or desktop computer. You now have to decide how to
structure your site. The document root for your site is the
*public_html* folder. You could put Joomla there. However, that prevents
you from using another application on the same site. For example, you
could have two entirely separate Joomla installations, one for
production (public viewing) and one for testing (private viewing). So
you could create a folder within *public_html*, named *j4* for example,
and upload Joomla there. You could have another folder named *j4test*
and put another copy of Joomla there. The illustration below shows such
a set-up with two Joomla websites.

<img
src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/thumb/0/01/J4.x-hosting-setup-cpanel-file-manager-en.png/800px-J4.x-hosting-setup-cpanel-file-manager-en.png"

data-file-width="1000" data-file-height="508" width="800" height="406"
alt="J4.x-hosting-setup-cpanel-file-manager-en.png" />

When you have decided on your structure, select you chosen Joomla folder
in File Manager and click the Upload button. In the upload form, select
the Joomla source zip file on your local computer to upload it to the
selected folder. After upload, go back to File Manager, select the *zip*
file and click the Extract button. After extraction, you can select and
delete the *zip* file.

That is it! You are ready to install Joomla.

## Local Hosting Setup with WAMP

If you are using a Windows computer you can set up a development
environment using WampServer:

- <a href="https://www.wampserver.com/en/" class="external free"

  rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">https://www.wampserver.com/en/</a>
- <a href="http://forum.wampserver.com/list.php" class="external free"

## Local Hosting Setup with XAMPP

If you would like to install Joomla on your own personal computer you
can do that using the XAMPP tutorial below.

## Introduction

XAMPP is an easy-to-install package that bundles the Apache web server,
PHP, XDEBUG, and the MySQL database. This allows you to create the
environment you need to run Joomla! on your local machine. The latest
version of XAMPP is available at
<a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/index.html"
class="external text" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">the XAMPP web site</a>. Downloads are
available for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X and Solaris. Download the package
for your platform.

*Important Note Regarding XAMPP and Skype:* Apache and Skype both use
port 80 as an alternative for incoming connections. If you use Skype, go
into the Tools-Options-Advanced-Connection panel and deselect the "Use
80 and 443 as alternatives for incoming connections" option. If Apache
starts as a service, it will take 80 before Skype starts and you will
not see a problem. But, to be safe, disable the option in Skype.

### Installation on Windows

Installation for Windows is very simple. You can use the XAMPP installer
executable (for example,
"xampp-windows-x64-7.4.4-0-VC15-installer.exe"). Detailed installation
instructions for Windows are available
<a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html"
class="external text" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">here</a>.

If you are on Windows XP or 2003 they are not supported by the main
package but there are compatible versions of XAMPP for these platforms
listed on the download page (but you will only be able to run PHP 5.4 or
lower - and therefore will only be able to test Joomla 3.x and lower).

For Windows, it is recommended to install XAMPP in "c:\xampp" (not in
"c:\program files"). If you do this, your Joomla! (and any other local
web site folders) will go into the folder "c:\xampp\htdocs". (By
convention, all web content goes under the "htdocs" folder.)

If you have multiple http servers (like IIS) you can change the xampp
listening port. In \apache\conf\httpd.conf, modify the line Listen 80 to
Listen \[portnumber\] (ex: "Listen 8080").

Joomla Community Magazine Tutorial

You can find a detailed tutorial on installing XAMPP on Windows, along
with the Joomla 4 Beta, the Joomla Patch Tester and Git in this <a
href="https://magazine.joomla.org/all-issues/june-2020/github-installing-git"
class="external text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joomla
Community Magazine article</a>.

### Installation on Linux

#### Install XAMPP

Open Terminal and enter:

    sudo tar xvfz xampp-linux-1.7.7.tar.gz -C /opt

(replace *xampp-linux-1.7.7.tar.gz* with the version of xammp you
downloaded). It has been reported that the MYSQL database of xampp 1.7.4
does not work with Joomla 1.5.22

This installs ... Apache2, mysql and php5 as well as an ftp server.

    sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start

and

    sudo /opt/lampp/lampp stop

starts/stops all the services

#### Test your XAMPP localhost server

Open your Browser and point it to

    http://localhost

The index.php will redirect to

    http://localhost/xampp

There you will find instructions on how to change default
usernames/passwords. On a PC that does not serve files to the Internet
or LAN then changing the defaults is a personal decision.

#### Get Joomla

Download the latest Joomla instalation zip
<a href="https://www.joomla.org/download.html"
class="external autonumber" target="_blank"
rel="noreferrer noopener">[1]</a>

Unzip to your hard drive

Connect to localhost with an FTP client Default

    nobody
    lampp

Create a folder for your Joomla on the localhost server

FTP the unpacked Joomla installation files to the newly created Joomla
folder.

**Important:**

- The xammp installation sets the correct Ownership of the files and
  permissions.
- Using the **CHOWN command** will **cause Ownership problems with
  xampp**.
- **Using nautilus** to manipulate folders/files on localhost will
  **cause Ownership problems with xampp**.

**Database info**

Host

    localhost

Default Database name

    test

Default Database user

    root

There is **no** default Password.

Administrator password is your choice.

Installing Sample Data is recommended for the novice user.

After installation delete the installation directory and point your
Browser to:

    http://localhost/yournewjoomlafolder

or

    http://localhost/yournewjoomlafolder/administrator

#### Creating a link in the Ubuntu menu

**To create a GUI for xammp connected to your Ubuntu menu**

Open up the Terminal and type

    sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/xampp-control-panel.desktop

Then copy the following into the gedit and save.

    [Desktop Entry]
    Encoding=UTF-8
    Name=XAMPP Control Panel
    Comment=Start and Stop XAMPP
    Exec=gksudo "python /opt/lampp/share/xampp-control-panel/xampp-control-panel.py"
    Icon=/usr/share/icons/Tango/scalable/devices/network-wired.svg
    Terminal=false
    Type=Application
    Categories=GNOME;Application;Network;
    StartupNotify=true

If the control panel fails to launch, try running the Exec command
directly in the terminal:

    gksudo "python /opt/lampp/share/xampp-control-panel/xampp-control-panel.py"

If you receive the error:

    Error importing pygtk2 and pygtk2-libglade

Install the missing libraries:

    sudo apt-get install python-glade2

#### XDebug PHP debugger

The XAMPP package for Linux does not includes the XDebug PHP debugger.
To install XDebug on Debian or Ubuntu:

\- Install the *build-essential* package:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    sudo apt-get install autoconf

\- Download the
<a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html"
class="external text" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">development package</a> for your
version of XAMPP and extract it over your existing installation:

    sudo tar xvfz xampp-linux-devel-1.7.7.tar.gz -C /opt 

\- Build XDebug:

    wget http://xdebug.org/files/xdebug-2.1.3.tgz
    tar xzf xdebug-2.1.3.tgz
    cd xdebug-2.1.3/
    /opt/lampp/bin/phpize

After this you will have following output on your consoleâ¦

    Configuring for:
    PHP Api Version:         20090626
    Zend Module Api No:      20090626
    Zend Extension Api No:   20090626 

    ./configure --with-php-config=/opt/lampp/bin/php-config
    make
    sudo make install 

Then the output will be this.. please monitor the directory specified.

    Installing shared extensions:     /opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20090626/ 

Create a folder in your temp folder that will holds the data file
generated by XDebug:

    sudo mkdir /opt/lampp/tmp/xdebug
    sudo chmod a+rwx -R /opt/lampp/tmp/xdebug 

Alternative installations:

Install using PHP extensions community library (PECL) bundled with
xampp:

    sudo /opt/lampp/bin/pecl install xdebug

On Ubuntu/Debian you can install using:

    apt-get install php5-xdebug 

(warning: this will also install Apache and PHP from apt repositories).

**Warning for 64bit users**

When compiling XDebug or installing via apt-get, you will receive an
error when (re)starting xampp:

    /opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20090626/xdebug.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64

This is because xampp runs 32bit but XDebug is 64bit. To overcome this
problem, either make xdebug.so on a 32bit machine or download it from:

    http://code.activestate.com/komodo/remotedebugging/

Download the file: "PHP Remote Debugging Client" for "Linux (x86)"
Extract the content of the file on your computer, this compressed file
contains several folders with version numbers ex: 4.4, 5.0, 5.1 ... 5.3
and so forth, get in the folder with the higher version number or the
one that works for you, then manually copy the file "xdebug.so" to the
following location, overwrite if needed

    /opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20090626/

Remember this location could be different on your computer

### Installation on Mac OS X

Mac OS X actually includes an Apache server out-of-the-box, but most
developers will prefer to use the integrated tools and configurability
provided by XAMPP.

As with most programs on Mac, installation is a breeze. Visit
<a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/en/download.html"
class="external text" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Apache Friends - Mac OS X</a> for the
universal binary download.

Once the file has finished downloading, just open the disk image, and
drag the XAMPP folder to the "Applications" folder alias.

To start the server, open "XAMPP Control.app" and press the start button
next to Apache.

##### A Little Troubleshooting

Many Mac users have a little difficulty at this stage when trying to set
up another instance of Apache on their machine. If you cannot start
XAMPP's Apache, you have two options:  
**You can change the listening port of XAMPP.** In
\Applications\XAMPP\xamppfiles\etc\httpd.conf, modify the line that
says, "Listen 80" to Listen \[portNumber\]. E.g.:

    Listen 8080

**You can change the listening port of the pre-installed Apache
server.** In finder, go to "/etc" (CMD+SHIFT+G); from here you will be
able to navigate through the normally hidden Apache files. Find the
folder labeled Apache2, and edit the "http.conf" file. Modify the line
that says, "Listen 80" to Listen \[portNumber\]. E.g.:

    Listen 8080

*Note: If you choose to change the port of the pre-installed Apache
server, you may need to restart your computer for changes to take
effect. You will also have to authenticate as an administrator to change
these files.*

### Test XAMPP Installation

Once XAMPP is installed and you have started the Apache service with the
XAMPP Control Panel tool, you can test it by opening your browser and
navigating to
"<a href="http://localhost" class="external free" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">http://localhost</a>". You should see
the XAMPP welcome screen similar to the one below.

<img

data-file-width="1498" data-file-height="883" width="800" height="472"
alt="Phpinfo on xampp.png" />

Select the link called "phpinfo()" in the top menu. This will display a
long screen of information about the PHP configuration, as shown below.

<img
src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/thumb/d/db/Phpinfo.png/800px-Phpinfo.png"
decoding="async"
srcset="https://docs.joomla.org/images/thumb/d/db/Phpinfo.png/1200px-Phpinfo.png 1.5x, https://docs.joomla.org/images/d/db/Phpinfo.png 2x"
data-file-width="1432" data-file-height="1282" width="800" height="716"
alt="Phpinfo.png" />

At this point, XAMPP is installed successfully. Notice the "Loaded
Configuration File". We will be editing this file in the next section to
configure XDebug.
