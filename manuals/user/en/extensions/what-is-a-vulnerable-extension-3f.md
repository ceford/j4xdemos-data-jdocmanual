A **vulnerable extension** is one that has been found to contain (or
contribute to) a
[security](https://docs.joomla.org/security "Special:MyLanguage/security")
vulnerability.

Vulnerable extensions are not necessarily poorly-coded. As the Web
evolves, technical requirements and commonly accepted coding practices
change. Active projects release new versions of their extensions as
requirements change. For this reason, it is important to:

1.  Know the version numbers of all installed extensions.
2.  Use only the latest stable version of all extensions.
3.  Completely remove all files of insecure or unused extensions.
4.  Check the
    <a href="http://vel.joomla.org/" class="external text" target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer noopener">Vulnerable Extension List</a> on a regular
    basis and remove or update any extension version found to be
    vulnerable.
