Anyone may write and distribute a Joomla! extension. As a service to the
global community, this freedom is actively encouraged and supported by
the Joomla! Core team. Due to the openness and popularity of the Joomla!
project, there are a wide variety of extensions offering a vast array of
features. The quality and breadth of Joomla! extensions is one of the
main advantages of Joomla.

However this freedom comes with a price. It requires individual
responsibility, and can survive only where a majority of participants
act responsibly. Joomla's success has led to unwanted attention from
malicious types, such as script kiddies who run simple, automated
scripts in an effort to find and deface others' Web sites.

It is important to note that, script kiddies unintentionally perform a
valuable service. They help us identify vulnerable extensions and poorly
configured servers that might otherwise remain open to more serious
threats.
