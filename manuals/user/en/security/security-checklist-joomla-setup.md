## Configuring Joomla!

### Install official versions of Joomla!

To avoid breaking your site, search the forums for reports of
incompatible extensions before upgrading to a new version of Joomla.

Upgrade to the
<a href="https://downloads.joomla.org/latest" class="external text"
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest stable version of
Joomla!</a> as soon as possible.

Download Joomla! from official sites only, such as
<a href="https://downloads.joomla.org/" class="external text"
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">downloads.joomla.org</a>, and
check the [MD5
hash](https://docs.joomla.org/How_to_determine_a_package_checksum "How to determine a package checksum").

Use [Web Page Diagnostic
Tools](https://docs.joomla.org/Web_page_diagnostic_tools "Web page diagnostic tools"),
i.e. Firefox Developer Tools, Microsoft Edge (Chromium) Developer Tools,
Chrome Developer Tools, etc. to ensure that all files were installed
correctly.

### Change the default administrator username

Change the user name of the default admin user. This simple step
effectively increases the security of this critical account 50% by
modifying one of the two variables attackers must know to gain access.
The password is the other variable. Change it early and often.
**([FAQ](https://docs.joomla.org/Security_and_Performance_FAQs#Why_should_I_immediately_change_the_name_of_the_default_admin_user_after_a_new_install.3F "Security and Performance FAQs"))**

### Protect directories and files

Ensure that all configurable paths to writable or uploadable directories
(document repositories, image galleries, caches) are outside of
public_html. Check third party extensions such as DOCMan and Gallery2
for editable paths to writable directories.

decoding="async" data-file-width="40" data-file-height="17" width="40"
height="17" alt="Joomla 4.x" /> In the Back-End Global Configuration,
change the log path. Some extensions use the built in JLog class. This
will, by default write logs to
<a href="http://yousite/logs" class="external free" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">http://yousite/logs</a> in Joomla 3.5
and lower or
<a href="http://yousite/administrator/logs" class="external free"
target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">http://yousite/administrator/logs</a>
in new Joomla 3.6+ installs. Change this to a place that a casual
browser cannot find (and don't pick /tmp/), or lock it down with http
authentication. Because we are dealing with Open Source software,
attackers can read the code of third-party extensions and may be able to
guess log file names.

decoding="async" data-file-width="40" data-file-height="17" width="40"
height="17" alt="Joomla 4.x" /> In the Back-End Global Configuration,
change the temp folder path.

If the log and temp paths are changed and PHP *open_basedir*
configuration directive is set, make sure that the new paths fall within
the scope of *open_basedir*.

There is currently no easy way to move the Joomla! /image and /media
directories. This is because thousands of third party extensions expect
to find these important directories at the current location. The best
plan is to make sure open_basedir is properly set for all the user
accounts on your server. Check with your host if unsure.

### Adjust file and directory permissions

**This option no longer appears in Joomla.** On Older versions of
Joomla : Once your site is configured and stable, write-protect critical
directories and files by changing directory permissions to 755, and file
permissions to 644. There is a feature in Site --\> Global Configuration
--\> Server to set all folder and file permissions at once. Test third
party extensions afterwards, and carefully review the code of any
extension that has trouble with such settings. Note: Depending on your
server's permissions, you may need to temporarily reset to more open
permissions when installing more extensions with the Joomla! installer.
**This option no longer appears in Joomla.** but is included for
historical purposes.

### Remove unneeded files

Remove all design templates not needed by your site. Never put security
logic into template files.

decoding="async" data-file-width="40" data-file-height="17" width="40"
height="17" alt="Joomla 1.5" /> Disable the XML-RPC server if you don't
need it.

Clean up after installs. The installation process will require you to
delete the installation directory and all its contents. Do this; do not
simply rename it. If you upload files to your site as compressed
archives (xxxx.zip for example), don't forget to remove the compressed
file. Check the /temp/ directory as temporary files may remain there
after a failed installation attempt.

In general, do not leave any unneeded files (compressed or otherwise) on
a public server. Each unused (and perhaps long forgotten) file is a
potential security hole.

### Turn Register Globals Emulation OFF

decoding="async" data-file-width="40" data-file-height="17" width="40"
height="17" alt="Joomla 1.0" /> Turn Joomla's Register Globals Emulation
OFF. Although this setting is somewhat safer than PHP register_globals,
you are much better off avoiding such settings all together (as well as
any applications that require them). On pre-1.0.13 versions of Joomla,
this setting is found in the globals.php file. As of version 1.0.13, it
can be turned off in the Back-end, under Global Settings.

<img src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/c/c8/Compat_icon_1_5.png"
decoding="async" data-file-width="40" data-file-height="17" width="40"

decoding="async" data-file-width="40" data-file-height="17" width="40"
height="17" alt="Joomla 3.x" /> Joomla 1.5 and greater, does not use
register globals, and in fact has smart code to defeat this setting even
if it's turned on at the PHP level. Note that although this makes Joomla
itself safer, any server with register globals turned on is potentially
vulnerable. Any shared server with register globals turned on is more
than likely a sitting duck. Any hosting provider that insists register
globals should be turned on is ignorant, incompetent, or worse. Was that
blunt enough?

For more information on register_globals, please see [Security
Checklist: PHP:
register_globals](https://docs.joomla.org/Security_Checklist/Hosting_and_Server_Setup#Don.27t_use_PHP_register_globals "Security Checklist/Hosting and Server Setup").

## Installing Joomla! Extensions

### Backup before installing

Before installing extensions, always backup your site's files and
database. This follows a very basic principle:

***Thou shalt at all times be able to return your site to a previous
working state.***

Therefore, it's smart to set up a simple and fast backup script to
automate this task. If you don't set up an easy process in advance,
you'll be sorely tempted to do a quick upgrade without backing up first.
This very understandable tendency is however one of the chief causes of
premature hair loss, sudden career changes, and even death.

### Check for extension vulnerabilities

Most security vulnerabilities are caused by third party extensions.
Before installing extensions, check the Official List of Vulnerable 3rd
Party/Non Joomla! Extensions. There's an entire site dedicated to
vulnerable third party extensions at
<a href="https://vel.joomla.org/" class="external text" target="_blank"
rel="noreferrer noopener">vel.joomla.org</a> we recommend you keep an
eye on it!

### Download from trusted sites

The fully qualified and official definition of a "trusted site" is one
that **YOU** trust.

### User beware! Check the code quality

Third party extensions come in all flavors of quality and age. Although
Joomla! coding standards exist, third party developers are not required
to follow them. Extensions listed on the official Joomla! site are not
reviewed for compliance, however if verified vulnerabilities are
reported, they will be removed from the list until they are fixed.

### Test, test, test...

Test all extensions on a development site before installing on a
production site. Then test on the production site. Don't forget to check
the logs for runtime errors and warnings.

### Remove junk files

Remove all unused extensions and double check that related folders and
files were actually removed by uninstall scripts. Note that during
uninstall, many third party extensions will leave related files on your
site, and related database tables complete with data. This is either a
feature or a bug depending on your point of view. Any files left on your
server remain accessible from the Web via direct URLs, such as
<a href="http://yousite.com/modules/bad_module" class="external free"
target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">http://yousite.com/modules/bad_module</a>.

### Avoid encrypted code

Joomla is (and despite disinformation campaigns, always has been) a GNU
GPL project. This means that all extensions to Joomla must also be free
(as in freedom) and open (as in readable code). Encrypted code may be
safe, but you can't determine this for yourself, and so you must trust
the developers. Using others' encrypted code puts you back in the world
of proprietary software where you must wait for security patches from
the developer, hoping that attackers don't find your site first before a
fix is released.

You are often not free to modify, improve, or share encrypted code.
These restrictions make encrypted code less valuable to the community as
a whole, and reduce the overall viability of the Joomla project which
depends on open sharing among all participants.

Of course, code that is not distributed to others is exempt from GNU GPL
distribution requirements. Thus you can encrypt Joomla-related code on
your own servers, providing you do not share it with others.

## Additional Joomla! Hardening Tips and Tricks

### Running on a non-vhost environment

When you are running Joomla on a non-vhost environment please make sure
that you set the `live_site` setting within the configruation.php to
your domain in order to protect you against potential **Host Header
Injection**. All sites that are running within an vhost setup are not
affected by this issue.

### Avoid shared servers if possible

For maximum security, avoid a shared server on which you don't know or
can't trust all the other users or their code quality.

### Enable SSL on your server

Servers with SSL correctly configured are currently the only way to
securely process confidential transactions and secure user
authentication. SSL works by encrypting all HTTP communications between
the Web server and Web clients. Thus, even if a transmission is
intercepted, it cannot be read. For more information read our [dedicated
article](https://docs.joomla.org/Enabling_HTTPS_on_your_site "Enabling HTTPS on your site")
in this Security Checklist (if you haven't already)

Joomla! 1.0.x does not allow you to assign an SSL server to individual
sub-directories. Search the forums for "Tommy Hack" for one way to deal
with this. Joomla! 1.5 and higher supports configuration of SSL options
out of the box.

### Use Apache's .htaccess

For an additional layer of password protection, you can use .htaccess to
password protect critical directories. This is usually adequate for
blocking the typical script kiddie, but be aware that .htaccess password
protection alone is not a highly secure method. It MUST be combined with
an SSL server for maximum protection. An SSL server is required for
protecting your site from more sophisticated attacks, such as packet
sniffing.

### Switch to Joomla! 3.x
