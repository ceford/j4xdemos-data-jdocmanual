If you have a Joomla! website where people you do not know, and
therefore cannot trust, are able to post articles, consider adding an
Editing Filter available in Joomla! to help reduce the chance someone
could submit data that could harm your website.

The safest way to allow people you do not know to submit articles to
your website is to follow these steps:

1\. Do not allow unknown persons more than Author access.

Q. How do I verify the access my website allows?

A. Go to **Administrator **→** Global Configuration **→** Site** to
review your *User Settings*.

- If you do not want others to get an account on your site, select *No*
  for Allow User Registration.
- If you are willing to allow people to submit an article, then select
  *Yes* for Allow User Registration and then select *Author* for New
  User Registration Type.
- Press *Save*, when complete.

2\. Select the strongest filtering Joomla! offers.

Q. How do I set Joomla! filters for Articles?

A. Go to **Administrator **→** Content **→** Article
Manager **→** Parameters**.

- Scroll down on the dialog box to *Filtering Options*. Select *Author*.
- Select *No HTML* for Filter Type.
- Press *Save*.

By using these options available in Joomla!, you can ensure that unknown
persons will not send data that can harm your database.

As usual, the very best way--and only real assurance--is to protect your
website with backups. Don't go without.
