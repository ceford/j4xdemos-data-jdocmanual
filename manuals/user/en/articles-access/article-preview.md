## Preview Access

When you have written an Article it can be useful to preview it before
publishing.

- Login to the website Frontend. You need to be logged in and have
  appropriate permissions to use the Preview feature.

From the Site interface:

- If you can edit the article in the Frontend, you can do so and use the
  *Save & Close* button to see the article.

From the Administrator interface:

- Login to the Backend and select **Content **→** Articles **→** +**.
- Set the Status to *Unpublished* or leave it *Published* and adjust the
  *Start Publishing* date.
- Make changes and *Save* the article.
- Select the *Preview* button in the Toolbar. A popup Preview window
  should appear.
- If you get a *The requested page can't be found* message, login to the
  Frontend and try again.
- To close the Preview window select the *X* button at the top right
  corner.

## Group Permissions

To check who can use the Preview feature:

- In the Backend select **Administrator **→** Users **→** Groups**.
- Select an icon from the *Permissions* column for the Group of
  interest.
- Enter *article* in the search field to search for articles or part of
  the article title to search for a specific article.

It may come as a surprise that Author, Editor and Publisher are not
allowed Administrator login! Also Authors can only Create and Edit Own
articles.
