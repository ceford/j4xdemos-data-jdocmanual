## Introduction

Dashboards are pages containing collections of modules organised in
panels that provide convenient access to aspects of site management or
site information. Most module panels can be customised or unpublished.
For example, the Sample Data panel in the Home Dashboard is not needed
in an established production site and can be safely unpublished.

On page load, some panels do system checks and you may see notices in a
distinctive colour. For example, in the Notifications panel the **Joomla
is up to date** message in green may be replaced by a **New version
available** message in orange.

You may restrict access to individual modules. For example, to restrict
access to the **Notifications** panel to **Super Users** only:

- Select the **Edit** icon in the top-right corner of the panel.
- In the drop-down list of actions select **Edit**.
- In the **Modules: Quick Icons** edit form select **Super Users** from
  the **Access** drop down.
- **Save & Close** - there will be a Module Saved success message in the
  Home Dashboard page.

Most of the items are self-explanatory links that duplicate those in the
Administrator menu or parcels of information that are hard to find
elsewhere.
