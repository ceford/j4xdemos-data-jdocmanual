Throughout the Administrator Back-end there are help screens available
to guide you in your use of Joomla! You access these screens by clicking
on the **Help** button on the toolbar. Each screen in the Administrator
calls a different help screen so the information you are presented with
is relevant to what you are looking at in Joomla! In addition, the *Help
-\> Joomla! Help* menu option presents you with an alphabetical list of
all the help screens. Some installed components might also include their
help screens on this list.

By default, help screens are pulled from a remote server at
<a href="http://help.joomla.org" class="external text" target="_blank"
rel="noreferrer noopener">help.joomla.org</a> and displayed in a popup
window. However, there is a setting in Global Configuration which allows
you to change the location of the remote help server, or to pull help
screens from a directory local to your website.
