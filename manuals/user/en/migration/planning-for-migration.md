<!-- Filename: Planning_for_Migration / Display title: Planning for Migration -->

Whether big or small, the first step in any migration process is
planning. If planning takes a week or four weeks, then that is what it
takes. Planning makes the migration process easier.

A few quick clarifying statements:

### Joomla 1.5 to 3.10.x or 4.x is a major migration

The underlying structure of Joomla core extensions changed
significantly. All data including core content, third-party extensions
and template needs to migrate from 1.5 to 4.x.

### Joomla 2.5 to 3.10.x and 3.10.x to Joomla 4.x is a minor migration (or a mini-migration)

A mini-migration means that the Joomla core extensions (Articles, Menus,
Modules, Categories, Contacts, Weblinks, Newsfeeds, Search) can be
upgraded with a one click update. All third party extensions including
template need to be addressed individually.

### Joomla 2.5 to 4.x is two minor migrations (or two mini-migrations)

If you are currently running Joomla 2.5 and want to migrate to
Joomla4.x, you will be doing two (2) mini-migrations. The first will be
from 2.5 to 3.10.x. The second will be 3.10.x to 4.x. See [Planning for
Mini-Migration - Joomla 2.5 to
4.x](https://docs.joomla.org/Planning_for_Mini-Migration_-_Joomla_2.5_to_4.x "Planning for Mini-Migration - Joomla 2.5 to 4.x")
for the links and best course of action.

### Requirements

Your server must meet the

Joomla 4 to migrate on the same server.

### Third-party Extensions

Joomla core is the easy part. Third-party extensions including templates
are what makes a migration increase in the level of difficulty.

### Final Thoughts and Considerations

There are many considerations for both major migrations and minor
migrations. If you’ve already done a migration from 1.5 to 2.5, and/or
2.5 to 3.10.x you’re one up on the process as it will be much easier
from 2.5 to 3.10.x and 3.10.x to 4 than 1.5 to 3 or 4. If you are
running 1.5 and going to 4, take heart, you skipped two migrations in
the middle. With proper planning you will have your new Joomla 4.x
website up and running with minimal surprises.
