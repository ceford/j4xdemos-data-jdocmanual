## Passed Your Self Assessment?

More complex questions to ask yourself one at a time:

1.  Do you have custom or uniquely modified extensions (components,
    modules or plugins) installed on your site?
    - If so, did you write them yourself?
      - If you wrote them yourself, you should be able to migrate your
        site to Joomla 4.x.
      - If you have custom extensions or highly customized third-party
        extensions that you did not write yourself, it is recommended
        you seek assistance from a coder/programmer to migrate/convert
        your extension to work with Joomla 4.x as well as a migration
        path to move the data from the extension from Joomla 1.5, 2.5,
        3.x to Joomla 4.x if applicable. See the <a
        href="https://community.joomla.org/service-providers-directory/listings/category/view/115-extension-development.html"
        class="external text" target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener">extension development category of the Joomla!
        Service Providers Directory</a> or contact the developer that
        wrote it for you.
2.  Do you have a custom template installed on your website?
    - If so, did you build it yourself?
      - If you built it yourself, you should be able to migrate your
        site to Joomla 4.x.
      - If you have a custom template that you did not write yourself,
        and you are not planning to replace it with a template that is
        Joomla 4.x ready, it is recommended that you seek assistance
        from a template developer to migrate/convert your extension to
        work with Joomla 4.x. See the <a
        href="https://community.joomla.org/service-providers-directory/listings/category/view/124-template-development.html"
        class="external text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">template
        development category of the Joomla! Service Providers Directory</a>
        or contact the developer that built it for you.
3.  Do you have constantly changing data (user data) on your website?
    - Some websites have a lot of user data that gets added to a website
      on a consistent basis (forums, users, shopping carts, etc.). This
      means that while you are in the process of migrating the site, new
      content from website visitors/users will be added that will need
      to be transferred to your development site before going live. Some
      extension developers give instructions for this. Other times, you
      will need to know some MySQL functions in order to proceed.
4.  Do you feel comfortable working in MySQL to add data?
    - If so, you may be able to migrate your own website to Joomla 3.x.
    - If not, it is recommended you seek assistance from one in the <a
      href="https://community.joomla.org/service-providers-directory/listings/category/view/119-migrations-upgrades.html"
      class="external text" target="_blank"
      rel="noreferrer noopener">Migration category of the Joomla! Resource
      Directory</a>.
5.  Do you have any extensions ( components, modules or plugins ) on
    your current site that have not been ported to Joomla 4?
    - Some extensions that were fully functioning for Joomla 1.5 or 2.5
      were discontinued and are not compatible with Joomla 4.x.
    - If the functionality is still important to your site, you will
      need to do some research to find replacement extensions and be
      comfortable with making configuration changes in those extensions.
      If you feel comfortable doing this, you may be able to migrate
      your own website to Joomla 4.x. If not, it is recommended you seek
      assistance from one in the <a
      href="https://community.joomla.org/service-providers-directory/listings/category/view/119-migrations-upgrades.html"
