Hi, I just started to familiarize myself with Joomla's caching, but I
came accross en error with the following piece of code:

> While testing the code we can use the following method to clean the
> cache:
>
>     cleanCache();
>     ?>

Assume I right that this actually should be:

>     clean();
>     ?>

I hope I am right as this is my first contribution to Joomla DocsÂ ;-)
