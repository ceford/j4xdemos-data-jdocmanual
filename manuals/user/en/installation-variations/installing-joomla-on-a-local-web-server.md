Note: This tutorial is targeted at a non-expert audience. If you need
detailed and advanced information, go to the

## Requirements

The first thing to do is to verify that your web server meets the
<a href="https://downloads.joomla.org/technical-requirements"
class="external text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joomla
Technical Requirements</a>,.

If you are not a technical person, confirm that Joomla is compatible
with the server by contacting the support section of your hosting
company.

If you are computer-savvy and you have a local web server using XAMP,
LAMPP etc. in your personal computer, you can be 99% sure that Joomla
will run just fine on it.

## Installation on Rented Servers

There are several ways to install Joomla on a rented web server but the
methods and procedures vary depending on the server configurations and
limitations. For example, some web service providers give you the option
to do a "one click install". Press a button and your provider runs a
script to install a copy of Joomla in your rented web server. If you
have hard time finding this option, contact support staff of your server
provider.

Caution: some providers may have a one click installation option **but**
they will install an old Joomla version.
