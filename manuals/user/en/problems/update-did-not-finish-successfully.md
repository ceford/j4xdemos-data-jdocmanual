In some slower shared host environments (for example, GoDaddy.com), the
automatic update methods can fail. This appears to happen when the
server is busy and the update is unable to complete within a given
amount of time. (For example, within 2 minutes for GoDaddy.com.)

In this case, the update may be partially completed and the site may be
damaged. You can repair the site using the [Manually Copy New Program
Files](https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Updating_from_an_existing_version#Manually_Copy_New_Program_Files "J3.x:Updating from an existing version")
update method.

Also, there is a third party extension called <a

class="external text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Admin
Tools</a> that can do updates on slower shared host systems.
