Logging in and out of Joomla!</span> Joomla!Â  4.0

## Introduction

One of the great things about Joomla! is that it offers the flexibility
to carry out tasks through the Administrator Dashboard (often referred
to as the backend) and, if enabled, to carry out tasks directly from the
frontend (the public facing) part of the website.

Frontend access is an easy and efficient way to allow content writers to
quickly add or edit articles without the need to go to the Administrator
Dashboard.

Your Joomla login is configured to control what you can see and do (or
can't) using Joomla's User Manager and powerful Access Control Levels
(ACL). This means that a Joomla website may have users that only use the
backend, some that only use the frontend and others that use both.

The following covers logging in and out from both the backend and
frontend of your Joomla website.

**Note:** Your Joomla Administrator may have disabled frontend access,
requiring all tasks to be carried out using the backend Administrator
Dashboard.

The steps covered in this tutorial are based on a standard Joomla!
installation.

## Log in and out of the backend Administrator Dashboard

### Logging In

Navigate to the Administrator Login page. This is the web address for
your website appended with /administrator, for example,
my-joomla-website.com/administrator

This will take you to the Joomla Administrator Login:

data-file-width="1000" data-file-height="562" width="800" height="450"
alt="J4x administrator login en.png" />

1.  Add your **Username**.
2.  Add your **Password**.

Click the **Log in** button and you will be taken to the Joomla! Home
Dashboard.

**Note:**

1.  Joomla provides you with the option to set up and use Web
    Authentication - this is not within the scope of this tutorial.
2.  If the website has other languages installed you will be able to
    select the relevant language from a dropdown list before logging in.

### Logging Out

To log out click the **User Menu** then **Log out**.

## Log in and out from the frontend of the website

### Logging In

If frontend access is enabled, a login form will have been added to the
website. Joomla allows a number of ways to do this. A standard
installation includes a login form in the sidebar of the website but you
may find a link has been added to the website menu, or perhaps in the
footer. In some cases a *Create Page* link may exist. The design of the
website will dictate where you access the login form.

In this example we use a login form on the website that is located in
the sidebar.

<img
src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/thumb/a/ae/J4x_front_end_login_en.png/800px-J4x_front_end_login_en.png"
class="thumbborder" decoding="async"
srcset="https://docs.joomla.org/images/a/ae/J4x_front_end_login_en.png 1.5x"
data-file-width="1000" data-file-height="548" width="800" height="438"
alt="J4x front end login en.png" />

  
In the **Login Form**:

1.  Add your **Username**.
2.  Add your **Password**.

Click the **Log in** button.

When logging in from the frontend of the website, you will be kept on
the same page that you logged in on. You will notice the login form will
also be replaced with a **Log out** button.

### Logging Out

<img

class="thumbborder" decoding="async"
srcset="https://docs.joomla.org/images/a/a9/J4x_front_end_logout_en.png 1.5x"
data-file-width="1000" data-file-height="233" width="800" height="186"
alt="J4x front end logout en.png" />

To logout go to the position you logged in then click the **Log out**
button.

## Quick Tips

- Some Joomla website administrators install extensions that hide or
  restrict access to the backend Administrator Dashboard. You may have
  to take additional steps or visit an alternative login URL.
- If you are making edits using the frontend login, save time by logging
  in on the page you wish to edit.
