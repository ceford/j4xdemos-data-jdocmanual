## Introduction

Modules are small extensions used for special purposes. Sometimes they
are related to other content items. For example, a Menu module is
required to display Menu Items used to navigate the Site. Sometimes they
are not related to any other content at all. Module content is usually
displayed in boxes above, beside or below the main page content. Also,
modules may be displayed on some pages but not others and to some people
but not others.

## The Site Modules List

It is worth looking at the Modules (Site) list. Select
**Content **→** Site Modules** from the Administrator menu. You will see
the Breadcrumbs, Main Menu and Login Form modules listed. The column
headings are:

- **Checkbox.** Select or Deselect all visible items in the list.
- **Order Symbol.** After selection, used to drag modules up or down to
  change their order in their assigned positions.
- **Status.** Published or Unpublished controls whether a module will be
  seen at all.
- **Title.** Select a Title link to edit the module.
- **Position.** This is the position defined in the template. The
  obvious positions are breadcrumbs and sidebar-right. There are many
  more.
- **Type.** The type of module is given because it may not be obvious
  from the Title.
- **Pages.** **On All Pages** is obvious. It may be *On Selected Pages*
  or *Not on Selected Pages*.
- **Access.** Public means everyone. But this may be restricted by User
  Group, for example Super User.
- **ID.** An identification number allocated by Joomla.

## Add a New Module

A good module to practice with is the Custom module. It is used to
display arbitrary content such as a message or announcement.

- Select the **New** button in the Tool bar. This opens a list of
  available Site modules.
- Select the **Custom** module. This opens the module in the Edit form.
- Enter a **Title**, for example *Announcement*.
- Enter the **Module** text, for example *This site is closing for a
  software update at 20:00 on Friday*.
- Select a **Position** from the drop-down list. In this case it will be
  *Sidebar-right* along with the other modules.
- Set a **Finish Publishing** date. This is optional but an obvious
  thing to do to make the module disappear after the event announced has
  passed.
- Save and Close. Reload the Site and see the result. Is it in the order
  you want? If not:
  - In the Modules list select the Order Symbol in the column headings.
  - Hover on the grab handle symbol for the new module and then select
    and drag it up or down to the required position. Note that selecting
    a column head symbol toggles the order so select as required and
    drag as required.

If you want another Custom module with another message go ahead and
create a New Custom module. You can have as many as you like with
different titles.
