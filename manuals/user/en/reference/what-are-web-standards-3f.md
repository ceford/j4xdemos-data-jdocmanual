Web Standards are documents or compilation of documents that contain
definition of technologies or guidance for defining technologies related
to the world wide web. These documents ensure compatibility and
accessibility among the competing technologies created by many vendors
and ensure that anyone who is willing to build or use a technology
according to the standards will not be forced to select a proprietary
platform. The most prominent issuer of web standards is the World Wide
Web Consortium
