This article describes filesystem permissions under UNIX-type operating
systems.

Permissions are a common source of trouble in Windows as well,
especially under the IIS webserver. Find that information at <a

## UNIX/Linux

Depending on the security configuration of your Web server the
recommended default permissions of 755 for directories and 644 for files
should be reasonably secure.
