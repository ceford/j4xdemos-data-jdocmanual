<!-- Filename: Why_can%27t_a_user_see_anything_on_the_backend%3F / Display title: Why can't a user see anything on the backend? -->

This usually happens because a user has been given membership in a group
with rights to access the backend but the group has not been assigned to
a viewing access level. By default most assets (mainly modules such as
the administrator menu and Quick Icons) in the backend are assigned to
viewing access level Special. So, most commonly you will want to assign
any group with backend rights to the special access level in addition to
any other levels it might be assigned.
