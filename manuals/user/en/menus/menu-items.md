## Introduction

Menu items are the basic navigation units of a Joomla site. After
arrival on a site Home page most menu items lead to other pages on the
site. There are many different menu item types. For example: a Single
Article menu item type will link to a single article; a Category Blog
menu item type will lead to a page with a layout featuring tasters for
several articles. A URL menu item type is used to link to an external
site.

## Menu Item Types

Menu item types are defined in each component that has site views. The
Joomla core has about 10 such components, each with several views giving
a total of over 30 types. The following screenshot shows the **Menus:
All Menu Items** list with a selection of menu item types beneath the
menu title in the **Title** column:

## Adding a Menu Item

To add a new menu item it is best to start from the menu you wish to add
it to:

- Select **Menus **→** Main Menu** or whichever menu you wish to add to.
- In the **Menus: Items (Main Menu)** list select the `New` button.

In the **Menus: New Item** form:

- In the **Title** field enter a suitable short title for the menu item.
- In the **Menu Item Type** field use the `Select` button to open the
  Menu Item Type dialog box.

- Select whichever type you need, in this example a Single Article type.

The **Menus: New Item** data entry form will change to display fields
that are relevant to the type. For the Single Article item type:

- In the **Select Article** field use the `Select` button to open an
  Articles list dialog from which to select an article.
- With the article selected check that it is being added to the correct
  menu in the **Menu** field at the right.
- Save
- If you wish to change the order of this item in the menu use the
  **Ordering** field at the right. By default it is last. You can make
  it **First** or to come after any other menu item you select.

- View the site to check that it is what you want.

## Edit Form Tabs

Each menu item type has a specific set of appropriate fields. Each type
also has a specific set of tabs to organise its fields. Some are common
to many menu item types. For example, Options, Page Display, Link Type,
Metadata and Menu Assignment are common to most. Blog Layout is common
to Featured Articles and Category Blog menu item types. Information on
these tabs may be found elsewhere.
