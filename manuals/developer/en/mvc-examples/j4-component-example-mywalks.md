## The J4xdemos-com-mywalks Example Component Tutorial

The explanation of this code is split into two parts:

- [Part 1: The Site
  code](J4.x:My_Walks_Part_1:_The_Site_code "wikilink")
- [Part 2: The Administrator
  code](J4.x:My_Walks_Part_2:_The_Administrator_code "wikilink")

It should be possible to take the tutorials in either order. Part 1
contains whole code files with some explanations whilst part 2 contains
more code fragments with explanations.

The installation zip file is available from Github:

- <https://github.com/ceford/j4xdemos-com-mywalks>

If installation fails you may have to create the tables and sample data
manually - see the sql files within the zip file. Some of the
explanations expect you to look at the installed code or unpacked zip
file.
