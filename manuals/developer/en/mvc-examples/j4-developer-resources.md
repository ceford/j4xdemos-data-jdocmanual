## Boilerplates

Boilerplates are skeleton extensions designed for you to modify to begin
building your own extensions.

### Example 1 - A Component Boilerplate

<a href="https://github.com/ceford/j4xdemos-com-bpsrc"
class="external free" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/ceford/j4xdemos-com-bpsrc</a>

Download and unpack this in your project file space, not in your test
web-site tree. After download, make all the changes indicated in the
README and you are ready to go.

### Example 2: A Boilerplate for Component, Module and Plugin

<a href="https://github.com/joomla-extensions/boilerplate"
class="external free" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/joomla-extensions/boilerplate</a>

Again, download and make all of the changes in the README.
