- **Type.** The Type of the plug-in. Some possible types are:
  authentication, content, editors, editors-xtd, search, system, and
  user. These are also the names of the website sub-directories where
  the plugin files are located. For example, plugins with a type of
  'authentication' are located in the website directory
  'plugins/authentication'.

<!-- -->

- **Element.** The plug-in directory name which contains the plugin's
  files. This directory will be located in the directory which
  corresponds to its type. For example, the 'Authentication - Joomla'
  plugin is of type 'Authentication' and element 'joomla'. So the
  website directory it is located in is 'plugins/authentication/joomla'

<!-- -->

- **Access.** Which user 'access levels' have access to this item. You
  can change an item's Access Level by clicking on its name to open it
  up for editing. The default user 'access levels' which come
  preconfigured with Joomla! are:

<!-- -->

- - Public: Everyone has access including website visitors who have not
    logged in

<!-- -->

- - Registered: Only users with registered status or higher will have
    access

<!-- -->

- - Special: Only users with author status or higher have access

  desired Plugin and then click the Enable or Disable toolbar button.

  and tutorials you encounter.
