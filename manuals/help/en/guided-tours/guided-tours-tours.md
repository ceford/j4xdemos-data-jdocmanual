<!-- Filename: Help4.x:Guided_Tours:_Tours / Display title: Guided Tours: Tours -->

## Description

The guided tours give users the ability to complete walk-throughs (or tours) to better understand the interface they are learning to use.

Each tour has mandatory associated steps.

Joomla comes with built-in tours, a good starting point to create new tours.

- Click the **New** toolbar button

To edit a Tour:

## Column Headers

- **Checkbox**. Check this box to select tours. To select all tours, check the box in the column heading. After boxes are checked the toolbar button 'Actions' get active.
- **Ordering**. You can change the order of a tour within a list as follows:
  - Select the Ordering icon ![Ordering icon](assets/ordering-colheader-icon.png) in the List heading to make it active.
  - Select one of the Three dots icons ![Dots icon](assets/ordering-colheader-grab-bar-icon.png) and drag it up or down to change the position of that row in the list.
  - In the Filter Options you may limit the list to tours that are assigned, for example to a Language.
  The ordering of tours in the console determines the order of the tours in 'Take a tour'.
- **Title**. The title of the tour. Edit the tour by clicking on the Title.
- **Description**. A truncated description of the tour.
- **Steps**. Access to the steps for the tour. Select the number to access the list of
   steps.
- **Access**. The viewing Access Level for this tour.
- **Language**. Tours language, default is 'All'. When using 'All', title and description can be language keys that will be properly translated into each user's language (assuming the language key values are available). Default tours are using language keys.
- **ID**. A unique identification number for this tour, you cannot change this number.

  To 'Search by ID' enter "id:x", where "x" is the ID number (for example, "id:19").
        Note that when tour titles and descriptions are language keys, they are not searchable.
