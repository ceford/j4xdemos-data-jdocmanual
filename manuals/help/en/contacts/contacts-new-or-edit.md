<!-- Filename: Help4.x:Contacts:_New_or_Edit / Display title: Contacts: Edit -->

## Description

Contacts allow you to list people and their personal information on your
web site, not necessarily registered users. You may also allow anyone,
or just registered users, to send e-mails to those people. The Edit Form
is where you add a new Contact or edit an existing Contact.

**Be aware:** If a contact has a menu item then the Contact Menu
Settings override some settings available here. Be careful not to
disclose personal information by mistake!

## How to Access

- Select **Components **→** Contacts **→** Contacts** in the
  Administrator menu. Then...
- To **Add** a new Contact:
  - Select the **New** button in the Toolbar.
- To **Edit** an existing Contact:
  - Select a contact title in the **Title** column.

## Form Fields

In this section, you can enter information about the Contact, such as
name, address, e-mail, and so on. The options allow you to control
settings such as what information gets displayed for each Contact.

- **Name.** The full name of the Contact.
- **Alias**. The internal name of the item. Normally, you can leave this
  blank and Joomla will fill in a default value Title in lower case and
  with dashes instead of spaces. [Learn
  more.](https://docs.joomla.org/Alias "Special:MyLanguage/Alias")

### Edit Contact

Here you enter the basic information about the contact.

- **Linked User.** Select the User, if any, that this Contact is linked
  to from the drop-down list box. This allows you to link this Contact's
  information to a registered Joomla! User. If this Contact is not
  linked to a User, select "-No User-".
- **Image.** Image to display for this Contact. Select an image file
  from the drop-down list box. This lists images in the 'images/stories'
  folder. Images can be uploaded using the [Media
  Manager](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Media/en "Help4.x:Media/en").
- **Position:** The Contact's current position.
- **E-mail.** The Contact's e-mail address. Note that e-mail addresses
  in Joomla! can be protected from "spambots" by enabling "Content-Email
  Cloaking" in the [Plug-in
  Manager](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Plugins/en "Help4.x:Plugins/en").
  This is enabled by default.
- **Address.** The Contact's street address.
- **City or Suburb.** The Contact's town or suburb.
- **State or Province.** The Contact's state or county.
- **Postal / ZIP Code.** The Contact's postal code.
- **Country.** The Contact's country.
- **Telephone.** The Contact's phone number.
- **Mobile.** The Contact's mobile phone number.
- **Fax.** The Contact's fax number.
- **Website.** The Contact's web site address.
- **Sort Fields.** To enable sort fields for Category lists go to the
  **Contacts **→** Options** screen and set **List Layouts **→** Sort
  By** to **Sort Name**. Then you need to use real words for sorting.
  For example, set First Sort Field to **Doe**, second field to **John**
  for the first contact; then First Sort Field to **Doe**, second field
  to **Jane** for the second contact. The third field is not used in
  this case. The sort fields are character fields so if you want to sort
  by age you need to enter 0x for ages under 10, so 08 for example.
  - **First Sort Field.** The name to use as the first sort field.
  - **Second Sort Field.** The name to use as the second sort field.
  - **Third Sort Field.** The name to use as the third sort field.
- **Status**: Published status of the item. Possible values are:
  - *Published*: The item is published. This is the only state that will
    allow regular website users to view this item.
  - *Unpublished*: The item is unpublished.
  - *Archived*: The item has been archived.
  - *Trashed*: The item has been sent to the Trash.
- **Category.** The Category this item belongs to.

  view.
- **Access**. The [viewing Access
  Level](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Users:_Viewing_Access_Levels "Special:MyLanguage/Help4.x:Users: Viewing Access Levels")
  for this item.
- **Language**. Item language.
- **Tags**. Enter one or more optional tags for this item. You can
  select existing tags by entering in the first few letters. You may
  also create new tags by entering them here. Tags allow you to see
  lists of related items across content types (for example, articles,
  contacts, and categories).
- **Version Note**. Optional field to identify this version of the item
  in the item's [Version
  History](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Components_Version_History "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Components Version History")
  window.

data-file-width="800" data-file-height="1035" width="600" height="776"
alt="Help-4x-Components-Contacts-Contacts-Edit-Publishing-Options-Tab-en.png" />

- **Start Publishing**. Date and time to start publishing. Use this
  field if you want to enter content ahead of time and then have it
  published automatically at a future time.
- **Finish Publishing**. Date and time to finish publishing. Use this
  field if you want to have content automatically changed to Unpublished
  state at a future time (for example, when it is no longer applicable).
- **Created Date**. This field defaults to the current time when the
  Article was created. You can enter in a different date and time or
  click on the calendar icon to find the desired date.
- **Created By**. Name of the Joomla User who created this item. This
  will default to the currently logged-in user. If you want to change
  this to a different user, click the Select User button to select a
  different user.
- **Created by Alias**. This optional field allows you to enter in an
  alias for this Author for this Article. This allows you to display a
  different Author name for this Article.
- **Modified Date**. Date of last modification.
- **Modified By**. Username who performed the last modification.
- **Revision**. Number of revisions to this item.
- **Hits**. The number of times an item has been viewed.
- **ID**. This is a unique identification number for this item assigned
  automatically by Joomla. It is used to identify the item internally,
  and you cannot change this number. When creating a new item, this
  field displays "0" until you save the new entry, at which point a new
  ID is assigned to it.
- **Meta Description**. An optional paragraph to be used as the
  description of the page in the HTML output. This will generally
  display in the results of search engines. If entered, this creates an
  HTML meta element with a name attribute of 'description' and a content
  attribute equal to the entered text.
- **Keywords**. Optional entry for keywords. Must be entered separated
  by commas (for example, "cats, dogs, pets") and may be entered in
  upper or lower case. (For example, "CATS" will match "cats" or
  "Cats"). Keywords can be used in several ways:
  1.  To help Search Engines and other systems classify the content of
      the Article.
  2.  In combination with Banner tags, to display specific Banners based
      on the Article content. For example, say you have one Banner with
      an ad for dog products and another Banner for cat products. You
      can have your dog Banner display when a User is viewing a
      dog-related Article and your cat Banner display for a cat-related
      Article. To do this, you would:
      - Add the keywords "dog" and "cat" to the appropriate Articles.
      - Add the Tags "dog" and "cat" to the appropriate Banners in
        [Banners:
        Edit](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Banners:_Edit "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Banners: Edit").
      - Set the Banner module Parameter 'Search By Tags' to "Yes" in
        [Site Modules:
        Banners](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Site_Modules:_Banners "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Site Modules: Banners").
  3.  For articles only, in combination with the ['Articles - Related'
      module](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Site_Modules:_Articles_-_Related "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Site Modules: Articles - Related"),
      to display Articles that share at least one keyword in common. For
      example, if the current Article displayed has the keywords "cats,
      dogs, monkeys", any other Articles with at least one of these
      keywords will show in the 'Articles - Related' module.
- **Robots**. The instructions for web 'robots' that browse to this
  page.
  - *index, follow:* Index this page and follow the links on this page.
  - *noindex, follow:* Do not index this page, but still follow the
    links on the page. For example, you might do this for a site map
    page where you want the links to be indexed but you don't want this
    page to show in search engines.
  - *index, nofollow:* Index this page, but do not follow any links on
    the page. For example, you might want to do this for an events
    calendar, where you want the page to show in search engines but you
    do not want to index each event.
  - *noindex, nofollow:* Do not index this page or follow any links on
    the page.
  - *Use Global:* Set in [Global Configuration: Metadata
    Settings](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Site_Global_Configuration#Metadata_Settings "Special:MyLanguage/Help4.x:Site Global Configuration").
- **Content Rights**. Describe what rights others have to use this
  content.
