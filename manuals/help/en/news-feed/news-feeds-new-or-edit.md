width="800" height="432"
alt="Help-4x-Components-Newsfeeds-Edit-tab-publishing-options-en.png" />

**Publishing Panel**

- **Start Publishing**. Date and time to start publishing. Use this
  field if you want to enter content ahead of time and then have it
  published automatically at a future time.
- **Finish Publishing**. Date and time to finish publishing. Use this
  field if you want to have content automatically changed to Unpublished
  state at a future time (for example, when it is no longer applicable).
- **Created Date**. This field defaults to the current time when the
  Article was created. You can enter in a different date and time or
  click on the calendar icon to find the desired date.
- **Created By**. Name of the Joomla User who created this item. This
  will default to the currently logged-in user. If you want to change
  this to a different user, click the Select User button to select a
  different user.
- **Created by Alias**. This optional field allows you to enter in an
  alias for this Author for this Article. This allows you to display a
  different Author name for this Article.

  ID is assigned to it.

**Metadata Panel**

- **Meta Description**. An optional paragraph to be used as the
  description of the page in the HTML output. This will generally
  display in the results of search engines. If entered, this creates an
  HTML meta element with a name attribute of 'description' and a content
  attribute equal to the entered text.
- **Keywords**. Optional entry for keywords. Must be entered separated
  by commas (for example, "cats, dogs, pets") and may be entered in
  upper or lower case. (For example, "CATS" will match "cats" or
  "Cats"). Keywords can be used in several ways:
  1.  To help Search Engines and other systems classify the content of
      the Article.
  2.  In combination with Banner tags, to display specific Banners based
      on the Article content. For example, say you have one Banner with
      an ad for dog products and another Banner for cat products. You
      can have your dog Banner display when a User is viewing a
      dog-related Article and your cat Banner display for a cat-related
      Article. To do this, you would:
      - Add the keywords "dog" and "cat" to the appropriate Articles.
      - Add the Tags "dog" and "cat" to the appropriate Banners in
        [Banners:
        Edit](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Banners:_Edit "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Banners: Edit").
      - Set the Banner module Parameter 'Search By Tags' to "Yes" in
        [Site Modules:
        Banners](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Site_Modules:_Banners "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Site Modules: Banners").
  3.  For articles only, in combination with the ['Articles - Related'
      module](https://docs.joomla.org/Help40:Site_Modules:_Articles_-_Related "Special:MyLanguage/Help40:Site Modules: Articles - Related"),
      to display Articles that share at least one keyword in common. For
      example, if the current Article displayed has the keywords "cats,
      dogs, monkeys", any other Articles with at least one of these
      keywords will show in the 'Articles - Related' module.
- **External Reference.** An optional reference used to link to external
  data sources. If entered, this creates an HTML meta element with a
  name attribute of "xreference" and a content attribute equal to the
  entered text.
- **Robots**. The instructions for web 'robots' that browse to this
  page.
  - *index, follow:* Index this page and follow the links on this page.
  - *noindex, follow:* Do not index this page, but still follow the
    links on the page. For example, you might do this for a site map
    page where you want the links to be indexed but you don't want this
    page to show in search engines.
  - *index, nofollow:* Index this page, but do not follow any links on
    the page. For example, you might want to do this for an events
    calendar, where you want the page to show in search engines but you
    do not want to index each event.
  - *noindex, nofollow:* Do not index this page or follow any links on
    the page.
  - *Use Global:* Set in [Global Configuration: Metadata
    Settings](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Site_Global_Configuration#Metadata_Settings "Special:MyLanguage/Help4.x:Site Global Configuration").
- **Content Rights.** Describe what rights others have to use this
  content.
- **Hits**. The number of times an item has been viewed.
