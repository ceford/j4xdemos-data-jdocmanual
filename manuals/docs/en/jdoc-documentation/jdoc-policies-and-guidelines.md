Policies and guidelines express standards that have community consensus,
though to differing degrees:
<a href="https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:POLICY" class="mw-redirect"
title="JDOC:POLICY">policies</a> are considered a standard that all
users should follow, whereas
<a href="https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:GUIDE" class="mw-redirect"
title="JDOC:GUIDE">guidelines</a> are more advisory in nature. Both need
to be approached with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_sense" class="extiw"
title="wikipedia:common sense">common sense</a>. A user who acts against
the spirit of them may be reprimanded, even if technically no rule has
been violated. Those who edit in good faith, are civil, seek consensus,
and work towards the goal of creating great documentation for the
Joomla! project(s) should find a welcoming environment.

Abstracts of current key policies and guidelines are given in the next
sections including links to their full text.

## Editorial style guides

The guides in this chapter should help authors and editors to preserve a
consistant styling and naming of the wiki-based documentation. You can
also see the <a
href="https://developer.joomla.org/en-gb-user-interface-text-guidelines/introduction.html"
class="external text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joomla!
en-GB User Interface Text Guidelines</a> that applies to all Joomla!
Documentation.

### Words to watch

**Please use \[<a
href="https://github.com/joomla/user-interface-text/blob/master/words2watch.md"
class="external text" target="_blank"
rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Words to watch</a>\]**

Words to Watch are words commonly misspelled or which may have
variations that depend on the Joomla!
<a href="https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:GUIDE" class="mw-redirect"
title="JDOC:GUIDE">style guide</a> choices.

### Summary style

- Sections of long articles should be spun off into their own articles
  leaving a summary in its place
- Summary sections are linked to the detailed article with a
  {{[main](https://docs.joomla.org/Template:Main "Template:Main")}} or
  [comparable
  template](https://docs.joomla.org/Template:Otheruses_templates#For_.28other_topic.29 "Template:Otheruses templates")
- To preserve links to the edit history of the moved text, the first
  edit summary of the new article links back to the original: add
  "spin-off of \[\[Original large article\]\]" into the *Summary:*
  field.

### Hatnotes

Hatnotes look like this.

**Hatnotes** are short notes placed at the top of an article before the
primary topic, generally either to provide disambiguation of closely
related terms or to summarise a topic, and explain its boundaries.
"Hatnote" is also a polite term to refer to **improper disambiguation
links** which exceed standard length, link directly to trivial topics
instead of a disambiguation page.

This style guideline is intended to make this process more efficient by
giving article pages a consistent look, and avoiding distracting
information (such as extraneous links).
