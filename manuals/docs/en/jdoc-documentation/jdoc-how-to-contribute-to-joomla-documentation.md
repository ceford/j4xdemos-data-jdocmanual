<!-- Filename: JDOC:How_to_Contribute_to_Joomla!_Documentation / Display title: How to Contribute to Joomla! Documentation -->

Joomla! Documentation is powered by the same
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki" class="extiw"
title="wp:wiki">software used by Wikipedia</a>. It's growth and success
is dependent on [individuals like
you](https://docs.joomla.org/Special:ActiveUsers "Special:ActiveUsers").
Thank you for taking the first step towards contributing to the Joomla!
Project. This page will show you how to get started and several ways of
helping the documentation effort.

## Getting Started!

There are a few things you will need to do first.

#### Read the Wiki Policy

You need to review the Joomla! Docs **[Wiki
policy](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Wiki_policy "Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Wiki policy")**
before you start editing.

#### Create a User Account

To edit the Joomla! Documentation Wiki, you will need a user account.
You may **[register for one
here](https://docs.joomla.org/Special:CreateAccount "Special:CreateAccount")**.
Afterwards make sure to confirm your e-mail address. Confirmation of
your e-mail address will give you permission to edit any page except for
a few that are protected.

*Note: If you do not do any edit within 5 days following the creation of
your account, your account will be automatically deleted for security
reasons.*

#### Create a User Page

After you have created an account, confirmed your email address and
logged in, we recommend you take a few moments to create a User page.
Creating a user page serves a few purposes:

- It lets users find out more about you
- It lets you make some initial edits so that the [Wiki spammer and
  abuse
  filter](https://docs.joomla.org/User:Abuse_filter "User:Abuse filter")
  can see that you're not a fake user. Note that for your first few
  edits, don't include external links as that will be what is most
  likely to trigger the filters.

A quick cheat to start your user page:

- On the user menu, go to your **Username** page (or use first menu item
  on far right dropdown)
- Click the actions drop down button<img
  src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/a/a3/JDOCS-actions-create-page-en.png"
  decoding="async" data-file-width="215" data-file-height="174"
  width="215" height="174" alt="JDOCS-actions-create-page-en.png" />
- Click Create
- Add the code to editor `{{subst:Newuser}}`
- Fill in summary (e.g. *This is my new user page*)<img
  src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/7/7a/JDOCS-summary-form-input-en.png"
  decoding="async" data-file-width="500" data-file-height="92" width="500"
  height="92" alt="JDOCS-summary-form-input-en.png" />
- Click the save button

#### Join the Documentation Communication channels

Joomla's official communication tool is [RingCentral
(Glip)](https://docs.joomla.org/RingCentral_(Glip) "RingCentral (Glip)").
[See this
page](https://docs.joomla.org/RingCentral_(Glip) "RingCentral (Glip)")
for information on how to join the conversation, and once you're in
there, search for the "JDocs Working Group" channel to join the
discussion on Joomla! Documentation.

You can also view historic conversations in the
**<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/joomla-docs" class="external text"
target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Docs mail list</a>**.

## What Should I Do First?

There are several areas of documentation which always need attention.
You can start by picking the one which is the most comfortable for you
to work on or you may get more involved by working on several at a time.
Once you have a wiki account, you are free to work on any aspect of the
documentation that takes your fancy. Even the simplest contributions
such as spelling corrections and grammar fixes are a tremendous help!

1.  [Help with documentation content](#Help_Manage_Our_Content).
2.  [Maintenance Tasks](#Wiki_Maintenance).
3.  [Join or start documentation project](#Documentation_Project).
4.  [Help with Help Screens](#Help_Screens).
5.  [Page Translation
    Explained](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Page_Translation_Explained "JDOC:Page Translation Explained")

### Help Manage Our Content

1.  Editing, rewriting and reorganising pages. Check our [Needs
    pages](https://docs.joomla.org/Category:Joomla!_Wiki_need_pages "Special:MyLanguage/Category:Joomla! Wiki need pages")
    for areas needing immediate help. They are called 'Needs pages'
    because they are in need of small tasks to complete them. Some of
    them are as simple as reviewing content or adding an image. Others
    require more content or improvements. Pick a few, give them a little
    love. This is a tremendous help to Joomla! users who rely on our
    documentation.
2.  Have some fun and browse for articles which are redundant, out of
    version(i.e. 1.0 and 1.5), or need to be split up because of version
    specific information. Then feel free to make use of the
    {{[delete](https://docs.joomla.org/Template:Delete "Template:Delete")}},
    {{[merge](https://docs.joomla.org/Template:Merge "Template:Merge")}}
    or
    {{[JSplit](https://docs.joomla.org/Template:JSplit "Template:JSplit")}}
    templates on the articles. *Click the previous template links to see
    how to use and apply them to articles you think need these marker
    templates. Add them to the very top of a page and the page is
    marked.*
3.  **Create a new page or tutorial.** If you want to start a new page,
    do some extensive research first. Try not to create a new article if
    one already exists. Use the [policy and
    guidelines](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Policies_and_guidelines "Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Policies and guidelines").
    1.  *Using wikilinks.* It's very easy to link pages using a standard
        syntax. If you create a link to an article that doesn't exist
        yet, the link will be colored red.Clicking a red link will take
        you to the edit page for the new article. Simply type your text,
        click save and the new page will be created. Once the page has
        been created, the link will change from red to blue indicating
        that the article now exists.
    2.  *Using the URL.* To use when you want to create a page from
        scratch. You can use the wiki's URL for creating a new page. The
        URL to an article of the wiki is usually something like this:
        `https://docs.joomla.org/YOURTITLE`. If you replace YOURTITLE
        with the name of the page you wish to create, you will be taken
        to a blank page which indicates that no article of that name
        exists yet. Clicking the *Create this page* link will take you
        to the edit page for that article, where you can create the new
        page by typing your text, and clicking *Submit*.
4.  **Help update images in articles.** Check the category [Needs image
    updating](https://docs.joomla.org/:Category:Needs_image_updating "Special:MyLanguage/:Category:Needs image updating")
    for a list of pages which need their images updated. Our suggested
    guidelines to help you are found in the article, [Image naming
    guidelines](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Image_naming_guidelines "Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Image naming guidelines").

### Wiki Maintenance

Maintaining a wiki and keeping it organised takes a lot of continuous
work on the part of administrators, editors and users. There are always
tasks needing attention such as: [attending to pages with
needs](https://docs.joomla.org/Category:Joomla!_Wiki_need_pages "Special:MyLanguage/Category:Joomla! Wiki need pages"),
that are [under
construction](https://docs.joomla.org/Category:Article_under_construction "Special:MyLanguage/Category:Article under construction"),
or by marking pages for
[deletion](https://docs.joomla.org/Template:Delete "Template:Delete"),
[merging](https://docs.joomla.org/Template:Merge "Template:Merge") or
[splitting](https://docs.joomla.org/Template:JSplit "Template:JSplit").
For all maintenance tasks and ideas of how you can help, please visit
our [Documentation Maintenance
page](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Maintenance_Tasks "Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Maintenance Tasks").

### Documentation Projects

- The docs team is working on [Beginner
  Tutorials](https://docs.joomla.org/Tutorials:Beginners "Special:MyLanguage/Tutorials:Beginners").
  Our goal is to make them easy to understand and navigate, something a
  Beginner can follow easily and learn basic concepts. Think back to
  when you were new to Joomla! and add a topic about something you
  struggled with as a beginner to the page. Better yet, join the
  [Beginner Tutorials
  Project](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Beginners_Tutorial_Project "Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Beginners Tutorial Project").
- Join the [Developer Tutorials
  Project](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Developer_Tutorials_Project "Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Developer Tutorials Project")
  and share your knowledge. Sign your name using 4 tildes ( \~\~\~~ ) on
  the [Developer Tutorials
  Project](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC_talk:Developer_Tutorials_Project "Special:MyLanguage/JDOC talk:Developer Tutorials Project")
  page and list what you might be able to do. Feel free to add some
  [tutorial
  topics](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Developer_Tutorials_Project/Topics "Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Developer Tutorials Project/Topics")
  to the suggested topics list.

### Help Screens

Unknown to many, all [Help
Screen](https://docs.joomla.org/Help_screens "Special:MyLanguage/Help screens")
pages are created and served to every Joomla! Installation worldwide
from this wiki! They are necessary for beginners and even those with
intermediate knowledge of Joomla!

**The Joomla! 4.x Help Screens need to be reviewed and updated**. Any
contribution you give to them will be appreciated by many users
worldwide and we're looking for volunteers to help with this important
task. A matrix needs to be put in place as well as an action plan.

## Things to Remember

Here are a few things to remember as a Joomla! Docs contributor.

- Don't be afraid to break a page, if you do and something has gone
  really wrong, revert your edit. Click the page's **View History** tab
  and you will see links to undo and revert.
- Write articles with a sense they will be translated to another
  language. Using slang or local dialect may not translate to another
  language or its inferences be understood. Find out more about
  [Translating Joomla
  Documentation](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Documentation_Translators "JDOC:Documentation Translators").
- Don't be afraid to download and read the general <a
  href="https://developer.joomla.org/en-gb-user-interface-text-guidelines/introduction.html"
  class="external text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joomla!
  en-GB User Interface Text Guidelines</a> that applies to all Joomla!
  Documentation. There are helpful hints on how to write for Joomla!
  Documentation.
- Words to watch when writing for instant feedback use Google Chrome or
  Mozilla Firefox browsers. They both have built-in spell checking which
  underlines a misspelled word.
- Don't forget to add the
  {{[inuse](https://docs.joomla.org/Template:Inuse "Template:Inuse")}}
  template to an article you are going to be working on it for a long
  period of time, more than a minute. It helps to prevent editing
  conflicts.

## Help, I don't know Wiki Markup!

If you are new to the use of ***Wikis*** and the simple markup to create
pages, then you can use the following for help.

- New WikiEditor contains buttons and quick links to make building pages
  easier. Click the word '**Advanced'** for a drop down of more buttons
  and quick formatting links.
- Use the [JDOC's Wiki
  Cheatsheet](https://docs.joomla.org/Help:Cheatsheet "Special:MyLanguage/Help:Cheatsheet")
  to learn the basic syntax commands. There is also a drop down of the
  common markup in the editor. Just click the word '**Help'** once and
  it will appear.
- Still afraid? Try these tools to help you create great wiki pages.
