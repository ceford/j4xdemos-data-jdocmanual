<!-- Filename: JDOC:Page_Translation_Quickstart_Guide / Display title: JDOC:Page Translation Quickstart Guide -->

This page should help get a translator quickly started with
documentation translations. For the more detailed version of page
translation, see [Page Translation
Explained](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Page_Translation_Explained "Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Page Translation Explained").
To signup as a translator, please go to [Documentation
Translators](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Documentation_Translators "JDOC:Documentation Translators")
add your username.

When your *userid* is approved you can find documents to translate for
your language at <a
href="https://docs.joomla.org/index.php?title=Special%3ALanguageStats&amp;x=D&amp;language=en&amp;suppresscomplete=1&amp;group=page-Chunk30%3AHelp+screen+column+header+Search+Term"
class="external text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Language
Statistics</a>. When you open a document for translation in a new
window, you will see a list of pieces to translate. At the top there is
a link to the document you are translating. Open this in a new window
and you have everything together. You can translate at one screen, and
check what you did translate at the other.

If you are already a signed up as a translator, you can play in the
[Translation
Sandbox](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Translation_Sandbox "Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Translation Sandbox").

It is good to know how parts of the documents are marked for
translation. In general it is this way `Text to translate` and when you
translate you will see *Text to translate*, which you can translate. The
is put by the person who marks the document for translation, the is done
by the system.

## The Interface

If a page is ready to translate you will see (images below) or a
variation (based on view of page):

<img
src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/a/ab/JDOC-translate-page-notice-en.png"
decoding="async" data-file-width="333" data-file-height="96" width="333"
height="96" alt="Localised view of link in English" />

<img
src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/f/fb/JDOC-translate-page-notice-nl-en.png"
decoding="async" data-file-width="631" data-file-height="82" width="631"
height="82" alt="Localised view of link in Dutch" />

After you click the translation link, you will then see the following
interface for translation. Documentation now has a ULS (Universal
Language Selector) installed which will automatically set the user
interface to their localised language. This is based on the browser (its
language setting) and/or geographic location. The language setting may
also be overridden manually by selecting the user icon (top right) and
from the dropdown click on the language at the very top. You may also go
to your user [personal preferences for
language](https://docs.joomla.org/Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-personal-i18n "Special:Preferences").

<img
src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/b/bf/JDOC-translator_interface-first-view-en.png"
decoding="async" data-file-width="1034" data-file-height="656"
width="1034" height="656"
alt="JDOC-translator interface-first-view-en.png" />

Now you are ready to translate, click any link in the separated message
units.

<img
src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/0/09/JDOC-translator_interface-editing-view-en.png"
decoding="async" data-file-width="1005" data-file-height="443"
width="1005" height="443"
alt="JDOC-translator interface-editing-view-en.png" />

You may click the suggested text to add it automatically to the edit
window. Then you may edit the text. The suggested text is provided by
translation services for free. There is no guarantee there will be
suggested text. The suggestion query may time out at the translation
services server.

When you are satisfied with your translation, save it. You can also skip
sections if you only want to translate some of the message groups.

## Page Titles

Page titles **can and should** be translated. They are the first message
group at the top of the editing interface.

data-file-width="40" data-file-height="40" width="25" height="25"
alt="Stop hand nuvola.svg.png" />Important!

**Do not translate the namespace!** This is anything in a title
proceeding and including the : (colon).

  
A page name is in a namespace when it looks like this: "**Prefix:**Name
of page".

This page name is not in a namespace when it looks like this: "Name of
page".

Please review this carefully, linking between pages will affect browsing
in any language different than the source language. The objective is to
provide links localised in the browsing user's language, linking to the
browsing user's language view of a translated page.

  
The information below is a quick overview. For a more detailed
explanation, see [Translating
Links](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Translating_Links "Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Translating Links").

### Standard Internal Page Links

Hyperlinks to another page are easy in the source language, they are
page names between `[[ (brackets) ]]` or the variations as listed below.
Good source page standards for page links will start to include the
proper link markup for translated navigation.

1.  `[[JDOC:Translation Sandbox]]` becomes [JDOC:Translation
    Sandbox](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Translation_Sandbox "JDOC:Translation Sandbox")
2.  `[[JDOC:Translation Sandbox|Translation Sandbox]]` becomes
    [Translation
    Sandbox](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Translation_Sandbox "JDOC:Translation Sandbox")
3.  `[[JDOC:Translation Sandbox|Translator Sandbox]]` becomes
    [Translator
    Sandbox](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Translation_Sandbox "JDOC:Translation Sandbox")

Links from a translated page to a page in the same language must be run
through a localisation link processor.

1.  `[[Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Translation Sandbox]]` becomes
    [Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Translation
    Sandbox](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Translation_Sandbox "Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Translation Sandbox")This
    above really isn't a nice looking link, nor is it shown in the
    reader's language. To improve the user experience, see the Dutch
    translation example link below.
2.  `[[Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Translation Sandbox|Vertaling Sandbox]]`
    becomes [Vertaling
    Sandbox](https://docs.joomla.org/JDOC:Translation_Sandbox "Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Translation Sandbox")Now
    a Dutch reader will see the link in their language. Just the same as
    above, you can name the link anything.

There is an alias to the word `Special:`, so you may also use just the
letter `S:` as a short version of `Special:`.

#### Important Link Tips

- Always use

      [[Special:MyLanguage/|]]

- Or

      [[S:MyLanguage/|]]

An example would be:

    [[JDOC:Translation Sandbox|Translation Sandbox]] 
      is translated as
    [[Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Translation Sandbox|Vertaling Sandbox]]
     or
    [[S:MyLanguage/JDOC:Translation Sandbox|Vertaling Sandbox]]

**So Remember**: Always add Special:MyLanguage/ in front of the the .
The is always untranslated. Always add a \| if it is missing and then
the translation of . Often this `Special:MyLanguage/` is already added
in the source document. So when
`Special:MyLanguage/JDOC:Translation Sandbox|Translation Sandbox` is in
the original document you only have to translate `Translation Sandbox`
and you don't see the total link.

### External Links

External links are easy to translate. They are written like this in the
source language.

1.  `https://www.php.net/` becomes
    <a href="https://www.php.net/" class="external free" target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">https://www.php.net/</a>
2.  `[https://www.php.net/ for PHP information]` becomes
    <a href="https://www.php.net/" class="external text" target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">for PHP information</a>

**What to translate?**

1.  This is a standard URL and will not require translating.
    `https://www.php.net/` It is a regular hyperlink and must be written
    as such. No translation required.
2.  This `[https://www.php.net/ for PHP information]` will only require
    the translation of **for PHP information**.

## Categories

<img
src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/thumb/4/41/Stop_hand_nuvola.svg.png/25px-Stop_hand_nuvola.svg.png"
decoding="async"
srcset="https://docs.joomla.org/images/thumb/4/41/Stop_hand_nuvola.svg.png/38px-Stop_hand_nuvola.svg.png 1.5x, https://docs.joomla.org/images/4/41/Stop_hand_nuvola.svg.png 2x"
data-file-width="40" data-file-height="40" width="25" height="25"
alt="Stop hand nuvola.svg.png" />Categories Require a Specific Method!

One thing to be aware of is that when translating a page, any 'category'
links in the page should be modified to also include the appropriate
language code.

  
The translation of a category is very easy, just add **/** to the end of
the category name.

### Do This

For example, if you translate a page from English to Spanish (language
code **es**) and the page contains the following category:

    [[Category:Development]]

You need to add **/es** to the end of the category name.

    [[Category:Developement/es]]

Category pages can be translated as well (which should be quick - most
are blank except for containing a parent category) and will be part of a
special categorisation project when ready.

To be prepared for this we can add **/nl\|Ontwikkeling** (Dutch
language) at the end of the category name

    [[Category:Developement/nl|Ontwikkeling]]

### Do Not Do This

There are a few things you should not do.

**Please do not do this**

Translate the word 'Category' or the name of the category.

    [[Category:Development]] to [[Categorie:Ontwikkeling]]

**Or this**

Translate just the name of the category.

    [[Category:Development]] to [[Category:Ontwikkeling]]

## Images

It is expected translated page will want to show images localised in the
language of the page. This is encouraged because it improves the user's
experience. Documentation only asks translators to follow a naming
pattern of images consistent with the source language of a page.

### Image Naming

Using an image used above on this page which is written as:

    [[File:JDOC-translator_interface-editing-view.png]]

#### Do This

Keep the name of the image and just add the language code to the end:

    español would be es [[File:JDOC-translator_interface-editing-view-es.png]]
    italiano would be it [[File:JDOC-translator_interface-editing-view-it.png]]
    português would be pt [[File:JDOC-translator_interface-editing-view-pt.png]]

If the file is not a localised file type (e.g Screenshot of an
interface) and is a graphic of something universal (e.g. a ball or
arrow), you should not have to rename the image. If the image has a
caption, you may have to translate the caption.

    [[File:ball.png|caption=This is a ball]]
    Will become
    [[File:ball.png|caption=]]

After you finish translating a page with images you will localise. You
should view the page in the language you just translated it too and
click on the "red" file links. This will allow you to upload the
localised version of the file.

Often the image in the document to translate has already a language ID
which is marked for translation:
`[[File:JDOC-translator_interface-editing-view-en.png]]`. So you will
have to translate **en** into your local language ID (in Dutch **nl**).
If the image has no localised items you want to translate you can
translate **en** into **en** to keep the original image.

#### Do Not Do This

If you don't insert your local image (because you don't have time at the
moment) it's better not to translate **en** into your language, else you
will have a "red" file link.

## Chunks

Chunks are pieces of documentation which can be used at more than one
place. There are big chunks, but most of them are small pieces of
documentation, sometimes only one line. For example, it is used for the
column headers in the helpscreens where the same fields are used in many
help screens

### Usage of Chunks

Using a chunk in a document is very easy. If we see:
<a href="https://docs.joomla.org/Chunk30:Help_screen_Show_Title"
class="external free" target="_blank"
rel="noreferrer noopener">https://docs.joomla.org/Chunk30:Help_screen_Show_Title</a>
we can use it in a document with the following code:

    {{Chunk30:Help_screen_Show_Title/en}}

If we use this in a document we see the following:

- **Show Title**. (*Use Global*/*Use Article Settings*/*Show*/*Hide*)
  Whether or not to show the article's Title.

So you will have to translate **en** into your local language ID (in
Dutch **nl**). If, after translation, the chunk is not available in your
language, you will see a red link. Use the link and open it in a new
window. You will see a message that the document does not exist. What
you must do now is: Remove the language code in the URL, in Dutch
/**nl**, Now you will see the chunk in English. Translate the chunk into
your language (only the first line is enough) and the chunk is created
in your language and visible in the source document. There is a more
sophisticated way of usage of chunks, with parameters. This way you can
pass parameters to the chunk in your own language. We do this with the
following code:

    {{Chunk30:Help_screen_toolbar_icon_Save/en|menu item}}

The source of this chunk is:

    *'''Save'''. Saves the {{{1|item}}} and stays in the current screen.

When we use this in a document the result will be:

- **Save**. Saves the menu item and stays in the current screen.

This way the translation of **en** will bring us in the language we want
and the translation of **menu item** will used in the **item**.

## Templates

Templates are reusable pieces of code which have a predictable result.

    {{tip|title=This is a tip|This is the body content of a tip!}}

Would look like this:

This is a tip

This is the body content of a tip!

### Do This

For the above example:

    {{tip|title=This is a tip|This is the body content of a tip!}}

You would have to do the following:

    {{tip|title=|}}

### Do Not Do This

Here is a list of don't do's.

- Never translate the template's name. The template
  {{[tip](https://docs.joomla.org/Template:Tip "Template:Tip")}} is
  called by the word 'tip' following the double set of curly brackets.
  If you translate the word tip, the translation would call a
  non-existent template name.
- Never translate the variables used in a template, only the value
  assigned to the variable. In the example of the
  {{[tip](https://docs.joomla.org/Template:Tip "Template:Tip")}}
  template, the word 'title' is the variable.
