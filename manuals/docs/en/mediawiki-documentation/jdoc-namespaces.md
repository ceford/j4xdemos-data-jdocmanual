<!-- Filename: JDOC:Namespaces / Display title: JDOC:Namespaces -->

The Joomla! Documentation Wiki is divided into namespaces. What is a
namespace? A group of pages put into collections of pages, which
differentiate between the purpose of the pages at a high level. Pages in
certain namespaces can also have special properties or behave
differently when they interact with other pages.

## Joomla! Versions

Namespaces are being used to separate Joomla! versions currently being
supported. The current Joomla! version supported are located in the
**J3.10** namespace.

### Version Quick Links

For convenience, a quick jump link to articles is either version
namespaces is located at the top of the article(right).

- If there is another article for a different Joomla! version, the link
  will say so by indicating, ***See*:JVersion:**.
- If the article doesn't have an associated article for another version,
  it will state **Only this version.** and link here.

Every namespace has an associated talk(discussion) namespace. The talk
pages are used for discussing the associated page. For example,
incorrect information, planning, suggestions, etc.

### Main

The main namespace is for general pages or page without an association
to specific version of Joomla! Examples:

- [Module
  Position](https://docs.joomla.org/Module_Position "Special:MyLanguage/Module Position")
- [Template](https://docs.joomla.org/Template "Special:MyLanguage/Template")

An exception is pages which can be applied equally to current supported
versions without the use of version separation sections. e.g. A section
of "Do this for Joomla! version X.x" integrated into a page. As soon as
a page needs examples, changes of code for a specific version,
procedures or other differences specific to each version, the page
should be version split into the specific version namespaces.

### User

When you create an account, you are given a personal user page. It would
look something like this, User:DocsUser or User: followed by whatever
username you used to register on the wiki. Think of it as your own
personal page. A place to experiment with wiki code, new pages or pages
you are thinking of creating.

### JDOC

This is the 'Project' namespace. Pages in this namespace are associated
with policy or guidelines, wiki projects and general user information
related to the Docs Wiki.

### Template

The Template namespace is used to store templates, which contain Wiki
markup to be included on several pages via transclusion. The main
function of templates placed in this namespace are to maintain
consistent formatting and aid navigation between articles, and usually
include several optional elements controlled by parameters to allow for
specialized use. Templates are also used to assist in a large variety of
documentation maintenance tasks.

### Portal

Pages in this namespace are a like the title of the namespace states, a
portal. Portal pages can take a user to many pages which are grouped
together by a subject, such as [Portal:Bug
Squad](https://docs.joomla.org/Portal:Bug_Squad "Special:MyLanguage/Portal:Bug Squad").
A portal for all things relevant to being a Joomla! Bug Squad member.

to all Joomla installations using the default help screens through a
proxy server.

### Help310

to all Joomla installations using the default help screens through a
