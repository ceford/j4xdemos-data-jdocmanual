# GFM data for Jdocmanual

Archived 2024-03-26 as the Latest Jdocmanual version uses separate repos for each manual.

This repository contains files in GitHub Flavoured Markdown format converted
from MediaWiki format. The files were personally selected as related
to Joomla 4 or 5 and are organised into four manuals:

- Joomla 4 User Manual
- Joomla 4 Help Pages
- Joomla 4 Developer Manual
- Joomla 4 Documenter Manual

To avoid single long alphabetic lists the manuals are subdivided with
titles that become paths in the repository. The menu-titles folder contains
data used to generate side menus in the Jdocmanual display.

Data has been gathered from original documents in eight languages,
although not all of the original English versions have been translated.
More languages may be added later.

## Images

Most of the images used by Jdocmanual are located on the Joomla documentation 
site (docs.joomla.org). A few are located here in the images subfolder. It
contains a manuals tree with the same structure as the markdown files tree.
It needs to be added to the images folder in your Joomla installation.

Also, to work for both Site and Administrator views there needs to be a 
symbolic link from site-root/images to site-root/administrator/images. 

Please see the Jdocmanual component for more information.
