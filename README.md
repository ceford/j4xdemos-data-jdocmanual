# GFM data for Jdocmanual

This repo contains files in GitHub Flavoured Markdown format converted
from MediaWiki format. The files were personally selected as related
to Joomla 4 and are organised into three manuals:

- Joomla 4 User Manual
- Joomla 4 Help Pages
- Joomla 4 Developer Manual

To avoid single long alphabetic lists the manuals are subdivided with
titles that become paths in the repo. The menu-titles folder contains
data used to generate side menus in the Jdocmanual display.

Data has been gathered for original documents in eight languages,
although not all of the original English versions have been translated.
More languages may be added later.
